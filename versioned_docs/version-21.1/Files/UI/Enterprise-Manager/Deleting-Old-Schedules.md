# Deleting Old Schedules

:::note
By default, OpCon regards any schedule in the Daily tables more than 14 days old as an "Old Schedule." The setting for "Old Schedules" can be adjusted by altering the 'Days to maintain in daily' in the Enterprise Managers Preferences. Refer to [Setting Preferences from Enterprise Manager](Preferences-from-EM.md).

To perform this procedure:

1. Double-click on **Daily Maintenance** under the **Operation** topic.
    The **Daily Maintenance** screen displays.
2. Click on the **Delete Old Schedules** button on the **Daily
    Maintenance** toolbar.
3. Click the **Yes** button to confirm the delete schedules message to
    delete prior to "day month year."
4. Click the **No** button to discard the delete request.
5. Click **Close â˜’** (to the right of the **Daily Maintenance** tab) to
    close the **Daily Maintenance** screen.
