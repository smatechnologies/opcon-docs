# Set Landing Page

SM provides an option for individual customization of your landing page, which allows you to change the default page that appears upon login.

To achieve this, locate and click on the **Set Landing Page** button ![Set Landing Page](../../../Resources/Images/SM/Set-Landing-Page-Button.png "Set Landing Page Button"). Youâ€™ll find this option in the top right corner of a number of pages, such as:

Every main navigation page (Home, Vision, Library, Studio, etc. - except Logout)

Every library page

Once you have set the landing page, the **Landing Page** button will show all-black ![Current Landing Page](../../../Resources/Images/SM/Clear-Landing-Page-Button.png "Clear Landing Page Button").  To return to the original setting and make the Home page your landing page again, simply click the button once more.
