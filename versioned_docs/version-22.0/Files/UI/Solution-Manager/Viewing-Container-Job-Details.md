# Viewing Container Job Details

Like Null jobs, you will only be able to view the Container job details
in **Daily Job Definition**. For more conceptual information, refer to
[Container Job Type](../../../job-types/container.md)
 in the **Concepts** online help.

To view job details:

Click on the **Processes** button at the top-right of the **Operations
Summary** page. The **Processes** page will display.

Ensure that both the **Date** and **Schedule** toggle switches are
enabled so that you can make your date and schedule selection,
respectively. Each switch will appear green when enabled.

Select the desired **date(s)** to display the associated schedule(s).

Select one or more **schedule(s)** in the list.

Select one **Container job** in the list. A record of your selection
will display in the [status bar](SM-UI-Layout.md#Status) at the
bottom of the page in the form of a breadcrumb trail.

Click on the job record (e.g., 1 job(s)) in the status bar to display
the **Selection** panel.

As an alternative, you can right-click on the job selected in the list to display the **Selection**Â panel.

Click the **Daily Job Definition** button ![Daily Job Definition Button](../../../Resources/Images/SM/Daily-Job-Definition-Button.png "Daily Job Definition Button")
at the top-left corner of the panel to access the **Daily Job

Expand the **Task Details** panel to expose its content. For Container
jobs, the following read-only details are displayed:

- **Type**: The job type.
- **Master Sub-Schedule**: The Master subschedule name.
- **Sub-Schedule Name**: The Daily subschedule name.
- **Sub-Schedule Path**: The Daily subschedule path.

:::note
If privilege has not been granted to the schedule to run as a sub-schedule, then the Task Details read-only field values will be hidden.
