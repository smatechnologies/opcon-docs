# Managing Script Types

The **Script Types** editor is designed to provide a way to create and
manage the script types to associate with the scripts that are stored in
the centralized database. Once the script type is associated with a
script, this association is used to determine which [script runners](Managing-Script-Runners.md) are able to run the script. In
essence, the type is what establishes the relationship between a script
and its runners. For more information about this concept, refer to
[Embedded Scripts](../../../automation-concepts/embedded-scripts.md)
in the **Concepts**Â online help.

## Script Types Toolbar

The toolbar resides at the top-right corner of the screen. Click on any
specific icon on the toolbar below to learn more about its
functionality.

## Right-Click Menu

Right-clicking on a script type in the editor opens a menu that provides
the same options as the toolbar.
