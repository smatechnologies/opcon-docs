# Managing Triggers

## Adding Machine, Schedule, or Job Triggers

:::note
Triggers can only be placed on the lowest level groups. In other words, if a child group is created within the parent group, the trigger can be placed only within the child group as opposed to the parent group.

If several child groups are created within the parent group, the trigger can be placed only within the lowest level child group.

Parent groups that do not contain child groups can have triggers.
