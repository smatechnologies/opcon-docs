# Property Expressions API

For programmers who need advanced functionality for controlling Job
Dependencies and Events, OpCon exposes the
Property Expressions API. Property expressions allow you to access many
system and user-defined properties to perform different operations on
them, the result of which helps you make a decision. For more
information, refer to [Property Expressions API Syntax](../reference/property-expressions-syntax.md).

The following use cases are discussed at the end of that reference
section:

- A job dependency on the specific string value of a property
- A job dependency on the specific numeric (integer) value of a
    property
- A job dependency on a machine running no jobs
- Triggering events based on deviation from estimated run time
- Setting the value of a property with an expression
