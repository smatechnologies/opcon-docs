# Managing Users

The Users page is found in _Library > Access Management > Users_, and provides the views to manage Users. A list of all Users that have been created in the system and a series of tabs is displayed on the Users page. Select the name of a User to view the details of that User.

The **SSO** indicator is displayed next to Users that have a Role that is configured for Single Sign-On.

![Users](../../../../../../Resources/Images/SM/Library/AccessManagement/users-page.png 'Users')

Selecting a User displays a series of tabs on the Users page:

- [General](User-General.md)
- [Roles](User-Roles.md)
- [Settings](User-Settings.md)

For conceptual help, see:

- [Users](../../../../../../administration/user-accounts.md)
