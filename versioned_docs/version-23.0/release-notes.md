#### NOTE: Users with large workflows may experience these performance issues in Solution Manager:

#### In environments with 60,000 jobs or more, Master Job management screens may experience increased page loading times. With schedules containing more than 500 jobs, Studio canvas may experience slow loading times or loading errors.

#### If these delays occur, the instances themselves will still run normally on the OpCon server. We’re working to address both of these issues and anticipate a fix soon after this release. We appreciate your patience as we continue to develop these new Solution Manager capabilities to bring feature parity and scalability for large workflows.

#### Installation

Without the license, if you try to define a new machine for this agent in OpCon and mark it up, you will see a license violation in the Critical log and core services will stop.

So, each notification trigger belongs to a single root group. Any pre-defined hierarchical groups will stay as they are, but only the lowest level of the group is visible in Solution Manager. Instead, users can define a 'Category' for each trigger as a way to tag them for a purpose. A trigger can have multiple categories assigned. The new system makes it easy to understand and categorize triggers.
NOTE: A bug in the latest release (21.6) may cause Notification Manager to not work for customers whose upgrade or install path had included version 21.4.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-14597**: Fixed an issue in Schedule Build where the schedules would not build "On Hold" even when the option was selected.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-14584**: Fixed an issue where validation was not case-insensitive and allowed the same name to be used for Vision actions, frequencies, and remote instances.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-14567**: Fixed an issue in Schedule Build where the pre-defined properties on a Named Instance schedule were not able to be updated.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-13063**: Requesting output for an invalid job in Solution Manager no longer displays an error. The option is now correctly disabled when the job has no output.

#### Utilities

:eight_spoked_asterisk: **OPCON-15335**: OpCon now includes a utility that publishes usage data (daily task counts) to the cloud and/or local file. The utility job is set to 'do not schedule' and needs to be updated with suitable arguments and set to build 'released' (it is installed with default arguments). Details of the utility are here: https://github.com/smatechnologies/usage-data

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15504**: Small fix in invalid data for SMAUtility schedule.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15337**: Fixed the transaction log backup file in the backup utility scripts to be initialized so it does not keep appending to it and grow forever.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-12473**: Fixed an issue with History.exe to purge/archive the correct amount of records according to the documentation.

#### ImpEx2 Web Service

:eight_spoked_asterisk: **OPCON-14859**: Updated ImpEx2 service (used by Deploy) to include SQL agent job enhancements - using Win Auth for package execution (DTExec) and running Integration Services Server packages - as part of the deployment to OpCon environments.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15461**: Fixed an issue where ImpEx2 did not start up if the database was configured to force encrypted connections.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15450**: Fixed an issue in ImpEx2 where deploying a schedule with a frequency having the same name but different case in the name deployed the schedule to target with some missing properties and missing job level frequencies.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15436**: Fixed an error with deployment when calendars associated with the schedule or package to be deployed does not exist in target server.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15401**: Fixed an issue where multiple embedded script versions referenced from jobs in the deployed schedule resulted in null pointer exceptions, as only one of those script versions was getting imported into Deploy.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15394**: Fixed an issue where global properties in environment variables for a job were not getting extracted into the deploy repository.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15385**: Fixed an issue in ImpEx2 where the target system's roles/access codes were overwritten with privileges from the source system in Deploy, if a role/access code with the same name existed on the target system.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15339**: Added startup check to make sure Impex is using a correct DB schema version. Added new CLI option "--skipVersionValidation" to skip this and continue without the check.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15268**: Fixed an issue in ImpEx2 where a change in a job's threshold/resource update on 'job status' and 'value' did not get deployed to the target system correctly.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15146**: Fixed issue where partial-match transformation rules only applied to the first occurrence in a string

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15136**: Fixed an issue where SAM reused an id for a job instance due to a race condition with Deploy

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15089**: Fixed an issue where wildcard named job and schedule transformation rules that have the same "current value" caused incorrect transformation rules to be applied to them. Also,
added suffix wildcard. "*job" will match if job/schedule ends with "job". "j*ob" and "job\*" will continue behaving as normal and will match if the job/schedule starts with "job"

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15080**: Fixed an issue where only one of multiple external dependencies to the same schedule and job were imported into Deploy.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15069**: Fixed an issue where a multi-instance schedule converted to single instance before deployment to a target system, did not get converted correctly on the target.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15067**: Fixed an issue in Deploy where updating frequency priorities for an existing schedule on the target system, caused a loss of some scheduling options on the frequencies of the newly deployed schedule.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15049**: Fixed an issue in ImpEx2 where blank batch users were "missing" in simulations.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15036**: Fixed an issue where Thresholds/Resources/Global Properties could sometimes get duplicate entries in the target environment when transformation rules converted source names of those entities to the same target names.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15030**: Fixed an issue in ImpEx2 where obsolete job dependencies in an existing schedule on target system were not getting removed.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15023**: Fixed an issue that allows Deploy to correctly prefix a schedule with the environment code in events.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15010**: Fixed an issue where scheduling options of the frequencies were not updated correctly if there was changes to them in the schedule that was deployed.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15001**: Fixed an issue where deploying a schedule with no documentation would not remove any existing documentation.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15000**: Fixed an issue in ImpEx2 service where checking available machine features sometimes resulted in a null pointer exception.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-14985**: Fixed an issue in batch deploy where the job sometimes ended in a concurrent modification exception.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-14898**: Fixed an issue in ImpEx2 where deploying a schedule with a department that has no role assigned threw an exception.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-14839**: Fixed an issue in ImpEx2 to prevent unexpected data loss when job threshold/resource dependencies or events were modified in the schedule that was deployed.

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-14830**: Improved error message content returned to Deploy when the OpCon API is unreachable.
