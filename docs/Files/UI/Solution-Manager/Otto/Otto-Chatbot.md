## Data and Privacy

Otto uses Azure OpenAI Services. The Azure OpenAI Service is a cloud-based service that provides an API for generating human-like responses to text-based prompts. The service uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model to generate responses. The Azure OpenAI Service is fully controlled by Microsoft and is designed to provide a secure and private environment for generating responses to text-based prompts.

Your prompts (inputs) and completions (outputs):

- are NOT available to other customers.
- are NOT available to OpenAI.
- are NOT used to improve OpenAI models.
- are NOT used to improve any Microsoft or 3rd party products or services.
- are NOT used for automatically improving Azure OpenAI models for your use in your resource.
- are NOT used to fine-tune any models.

The Azure OpenAI Service is fully controlled by Microsoft; Microsoft hosts the OpenAI models in Microsoftâ€™s Azure environment and the Service does NOT interact with any services operated by OpenAI (e.g. ChatGPT, or the OpenAI API). To reduce the risk of harmful use of the Azure OpenAI Service, the Azure OpenAI Service includes both content filtering and abuse monitoring features.

#### Chat Tool Definitions

Chat tool definitions are provided by the OpCon REST API. These definitions are used to provide context to the chatbot and to help the chatbot to determine if the user is asking a question about OpCon or if they would like to execute a skill.

#### Data Sources

The data sources used by the chatbot include OpCon help documentation. The chatbot uses the OpCon documentation to provide answers to questions about OpCon.
