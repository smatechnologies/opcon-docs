#  Configuring Master Schedule User Inputs

When configured, the Master Schedule User Input will be displayed as a
drop-down list of Master Schedules on which the logged user has
privileges when he or she runs the Service Request.



To configure the user input:



1.  Double-click on the specific User Input in the **User Inputs** list
    on the **Service Request definition** page or click the blue
    **Edit** button next to the desired user input to edit.
2.  Enter the *User Input Caption* to display when users run the Service
    Request. By default, the Variable name is used.
3.  Toggle the **Required Variable** switch if you want to require the
    user to input a value for this field.
4.  Select **Master Schedule** in the **User Input Type** drop-down list
    to define that type of input to present when users run the Service
    Request.
5.  Click the **OK** button to confirm User Input configuration, or
    click the **Cancel** button to discard changes. This will return you
    to the **Service Request definition** page.
