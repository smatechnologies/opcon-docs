To generate external tokens:

Log into the Solution Manager, if not already logged in.

Click on the **user profile** button located in the **Navigation** menu,
as shown in the graphic.

Select one of the following radio buttons to specify which type of
external token to generate:

- **API Token**: Selecting this option will allow you to generate an
    external token that can also be used for APIÂ authentication.
- **Custom Length**: Selecting this option will allow you to set the
    length (ranging from 8 to 35 characters) of the external token that
    will be generated. If this option is selected, then the token cannot
    be used for API authentication.

Click **Generate** to generate the external token.
