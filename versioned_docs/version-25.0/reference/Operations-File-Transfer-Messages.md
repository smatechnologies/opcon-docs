#  Operations File Transfer Messages

In addition to displaying the completion percentage and the interim transfer operations (e.g., compressing, decompressing, etc.), the EM displays specific file transfer codes from the LSAM's participating in the file transfer job. The Origination column identifies the error 
location: the FTAgent (Destination) and/or the FTServer (Source).

## UNIX File Transfer Error Codes

File transfer errors received by STDOUT/STDERR may be viewed in the EM's Job Output Retrieval System (JORS).

The messages in this section are output by the UNIX Agent and Server; messages output by a non-UNIX Agent or Server will be different, and the user is referred to the documentation for the appropriate LSAM. When the destination machine is UNIX and an error originates in the Server, the Agent will prepend "FTServer:" to the message to indicate that it originated with the Server. 

:::tip Example
FTServer: Error reading Temp File ```[/usr/local/lsam/tmp/FT_AHhs5/daily.txt.asc.10203]```
:::

### STDOUT

| Message | Origination | Explanation |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| Original Destination File <br />\[*desf*] backed up to \[backup] | FTAgent | Per the job's "Overwrite" option. the FTAgent backed up the Destination File prior to starting the file transfer. |
| Original Destination File <br />\[*file*] did not exist to backup | FTAgent | At the job's startup, no Destination File exists to backup. |
| Could not change default access permissions for Destination File \[*desf*] | FTAgent | Following the transfer of a new Destination File, the new file's access privileges could not be changed from the system-dependent default to:<br /><br />- full access by owner<br />- read access by group<br />- no access by others<br /><br />NOTE: If the Destination file existed before the file transfer, the file transfer does not modify its access permissions. |
| \[*src_machine*]src_file --> \[*dest_mach*]dest_file | FTAgent| - Displays the results of the file transfer.<br />- The Destination File was created or overwritten.<br />- Shown if the job's "Overwrite" option specified appending, but the Destination File did not exist prior to the file transfer. |
| \[*src_machine*]src_file appended --> \[*dest_machine*]dest_file | FTAgent | - Displays the results of the file transfer.<br />- The Source File was appended to the Destination File. |
| File transfer successfully completed | FTAgent | The job ran to completion. |
| File transfer did not complete! | FTAgent | The job did not run to completion. The file may or may not have been transferred. Refer to the job's STDERR output for details of what went wrong. |


### STDERR

Written to a job's STDERR file when the job requirements could not be met. The following messages are Pre-Processing Errors.

| Message | Origination | Explanation |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| User does not have required access to Source File \[*file*] | FTServer | The file transfer was aborted because the user did no have READ access to the Source File. |
| User does not have required access to Destination File \[*file*] | FTAgent | The file transfer was aborted because the user did not have WRITE access to the Destination File OR CREATE access to the Destination directory. |
| Invalid path component in Destination File \[*file*] | FTAgent | The file transfer was aborted because the user specified a non-existent directory within the path portion of the Destination File, i.e., that portion of the Destination File prior to the final '/' in the filename. |
| Destination File \[*file*] already exists and overwrite not allowed. | FTAgent | The file transfer was aborted because the Destination File already existed, and the user specified "Do Not Overwrite" for the job's "Overwrite" option. |
| Could not back-up Destination File \[*file*] (*indicator*) | FTAgent | - The file transfer was aborted becuase the Destination File could not be backed up as the user specified for the job's "Overwrite" option.<br />- The indicator field provides the specific reason. |
| Compression REQUIRED but not supported by both machines | FTAgent | The file transfer was aborted because compatible forms of file compression were not available on both the Source and Destination machine. |
| Compresssion is FAIL-PREFERRED but not supported by both machines.<br />Continuing without compression - job status will be FAILED\... | FTAgent | - The file transfer was initiated without file compression.<br />- If it was successful, OpCon reported the job as Failed because the user checked the "Send fail\..." box under Failure Criteria in the Job Details screen. |
| Compression is not supported by both machines.<br />Continuing without compression\... | FTAgent | The file transfer was initiated without file compression. |
| Encryption REQUIRED but not supported by both machines | FTAgent | The file transfer was aborted because compatible forms of file encryption were not available on both the Source and Destination machines. |
| Encryption is FAIL-PREFERRED but not supported by both machines.<br />Continuing without encryption - job stat us will be FAILED\... | FTAgent | - The file transfer was initiated without file encryption.<br />- If it was successful, OpCon reported the job as Failed because the user checked the "Send fail\..." box under Failure Criteria in the Job Details screen. |
| Encryption is not supported by both machines.<br />Continuing without encryption\... | FTAgent | The file transfer was initiated without file encryption. |
| Unsupported Data Type \[*type*] | FTAgent<br />FTServer | The file transfer was aborted because the indicated data type is not supported. |
| Cannot Process <CommonCharSet\> of \[*charset*] | FTAgent | FTAgent is unable to translate the intermediate character set chosen but the FTServer to affect the transfer when the Source and Destination's data types differ. | 

#### Processing Errors

:::note
Occurrence of an error does not necessarily (but usually does) mean that a job is aborted. If the job does complete successfully, it may indicate some marginal operating conditions in need of attention.

The most likely cause for a missing index file is either that the source file was not previously saved by the FTAgent as a record-oriented destination file, or that the index file was accidentally deleted. A native, stream format, file cannot be sent as a record-oriented file unless it is first transferred to itself/another file/another UNIX system as a record-oriented destination file. |
