## Adding a Role

The **Access Management** page is found in _Library > Access Management_, and provides the views to manage User Accounts, Privileges, and Roles.

Select the **Roles** tab to see a list of all the roles that have been created in the system. From the upper right hand corner of the list of roles, select the "..." icon and then select **Create New Role**. The **Create New Role** dialog box is displayed.

Selecting the **Create New Role** button opens the **Create New Role** dialog box.

From this dialog box, you can create a new role (i.e., add name and description) and assign privileges to the role.
