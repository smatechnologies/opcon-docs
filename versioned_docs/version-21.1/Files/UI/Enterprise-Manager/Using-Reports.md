# Using Reports

The **Reports** view is used to select the report and utilize the report
selection options for viewing purposes. For conceptual information on
reports, refer to [OpCon Reporting](../../../reports/overview.md) in the
**Reports** online help. Reports can also be automatically generated
using the BIRT Report Generator. Refer to [BIRT Report Generator](../../../utilities/Command-line-Utilities/BIRT-Report-Generator.md)
 in the **Utilities** online help. In medium to large
environments, the reports can run out of memory due to the amount of
data.

Upon activation, the **Reports** screen displays a
drop-down list for selecting the preferred reports. Depending upon your
report selection , the appropriate report will display in the
**Reports** view.
