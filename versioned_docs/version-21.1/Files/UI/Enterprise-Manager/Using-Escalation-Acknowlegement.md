# Using Escalation Acknowledgment

The **Escalation Acknowledgment** view is used to view and acknowledge
escalations. For more information on how to set up escalation rules, refer
to [Using Escalation Manager](Using-Escalation-Manager.md).

When on the **Escalation Acknowledgment** screen, it lists any
escalations that have not been acknowledged. The screen shows the following information for each
escalation:

- **Date**: The date of the
    escalation.
- **Notification**: The subject of the email notification pending
    acknowledgment.
- **Escalation Level**: The current level of the
    escalation, as defined in the rule     sequence.
- **Status**: The current state of the
    escalation's acknowledgment.     Status has two states:
  - **Pending**: An escalation is         awaiting acknowledgment and has been sent to one or more groups
        of users who are part of the
        escalation rule.
  - **Exhausted**: An escalation
        has been sent to all groups of users in the rule, but has not
        been acknowledged.
