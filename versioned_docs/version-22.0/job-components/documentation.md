# Documentation

The *documentation* for each job is user-defined information (e.g., command history, instructions for operators in case of failure, etc.). Documentation can be associated with the job or with individual frequencies for the job. Frequency-level documentation can only be added after at least one frequency has been defined.

The following information applies to documentation associated with the job:

- **Schedule Name**: Defines the name of the schedule.
- **Job Name**: Defines the name of the job.
- **Job Documentation**: Contains the user-defined information that is always associated with the job.
- **Frequency Name**: Defines the name of the frequency if the documentation is defined for a specific frequency. The list box contains the names of all frequencies defined for the selected job in order of priority.
- **Frequency Documentation**: Contains the user-defined information that is associated the Frequency Name and included with the job only when the job runs with the associated frequency.
