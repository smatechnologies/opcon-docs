# Managing Calendars

The **Calendars** editor is used to define and maintain
OpCon Calendars. The editor contains a list
of existing calendars with a date list to indicate the month and day(s)
involved with the calendar and a table to indicate the schedules, jobs,
and frequencies using the calendar. For conceptual information, refer to
[Calendars](../../../objects/calendars.md) in the
**Concepts** online help.

## Calendars Toolbar

The **Calendars** editor also has a toolbar that allows you to perform
functions for managing the calendars. Click on any specific icon on the
toolbar below to learn more about its functionality.
