### Filtering & Sorting

Because this report contains large amounts of data, a schedule date filter will be applied by default to only show dates on or after the current date. You can adjust this or add filters to other columns in the filters panel (shown below). You can open the filters panel by either selecting the filter icon in the header or columns that have an active filter, or by clicking on the menu (three dots) in the header of any column, and selecting 'Filter' (also shown below). The default filter can be adjusted.
