# Managing Users

The **Users** page is found in _Library > Access Management > Users_, and provides the views to manage users. A list of all users that have been created in the system and a series of tabs is displayed on the users page. Select the name of a user to view the details of that user.

The **SSO** indicator is displayed next to users that have a role that is configured for Single Sign-On.

![Users](../../../../../../Resources/Images/SM/Library/AccessManagement/users-page.png 'Users')

To sort the users, select the sort icon ![Sort Icon](../../../../../../Resources/Images/SM/Library/AccessManagement/sort-icon.png 'Sort Icon').

Selecting a user displays a series of tabs that allow you to view and modify the details of the selected user. The tabs are:

- [General](Modifying-Users/General.md)
- [Roles](Modifying-Users/Roles.md)
- [Settings](Modifying-Users/Settings.md)

To add, copy, or delete a user, use the context menu button ![Context Menu Button](../../../../../../Resources/Images/SM/Library/AccessManagement/context-menu.png 'Context Menu Button'). See the following sections for more information:

- [Adding Users](Adding-Users.md)
- [Deleting Users](Deleting-Users.md)
- [Copying Users](Copying-Users.md)
