# Editing Job Frequencies

:::note
You can modify the frequency if it applies only to the selected job; however, to modify a frequency that is on two or more jobs, you must be in the **ocadm** role.
:::

:::note
In the ocadm role, if a previously defined job frequency is being changed, and it is in use by other jobs or schedules, all jobs or schedules using the frequency will be impacted by the change. 

When saving the changes to a previously defined frequency, if it is in use by other jobs or schedules, a pop-up message will be displayed warning you that all jobs and schedules using the frequency will be impacted by the change.

If it is a requirement to change all jobs and schedules with the frequency, continue with saving the changes. If this is not the case, create a new frequency with a new frequency name.
