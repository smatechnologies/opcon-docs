#  Using Bar Chart View

The **Bar Chart** view displays the Daily statistics with each bar
representing the schedules for that day grouped together by job status.
There are a few preferences relating to the bar chart that can be
changed according to your preference. For additional information on
changing these preferences, refer to [Setting Preferences for Charts](Preferences-for-Charts.md).

 

When on the **Bar Chart** screen, it shows a bar chart representation of
jobs grouped together by status for either a schedule or a day. The
schedule name or the date appears above the bar chart. In order for the
schedule and jobs information to display in the **Bar Chart** view, you
**must** first click on the **Listen for selection changes in other
views** button on the **Bar Chart** toolbar.

 

The **Send the current selection to other views** button must also be
activated in another view (e.g., **Daily list** and/or **Matrix**).

## Bar Chart Toolbar

The **Bar Chart** view also has a toolbar that allows you to perform
actions in the view. Click on any specific icon on the toolbar below to
learn more about its functionality.
