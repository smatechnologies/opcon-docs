# Job Documentation

The **Documentation** tab in the [**Job Master**](Using-Job-Master.md) editor allows you to define and
maintain any information relating to the job (e.g., command history for
the job, instructions for operators in the case of failure, etc.).
Within the tab, you will be able to:

- [Add Documentation](Adding-Documentation.md)
- [Enter and Open Hyperlinks](Entering-and-Opening-Hyperlinks.md)

For conceptual information, refer to
[Documentation](../../../job-components/documentation.md) in the
**Concepts** online help.
