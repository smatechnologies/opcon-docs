# OpCon Server Options

The **Enterprise Manager Administration** supports management of Server Options in OpCon. Only the OpCon administrative users in the ocadm role can access the options. Refer to [Managing Server Options](../Files/UI/Enterprise-Manager/Managing-Server-Options.md) in the **Enterprise Manager** online help.

## General Settings

The General category contains default behavior settings for the SAM.

|||||
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Job Dependency Offset Type|Calendar Days|Y|This parameter determines if the Job Dependencies with Offset values are calculated with calendar days or with occurrence of the job.If Calendar Days is selected, OpCon will look for the job on the specified number of calendar days offset from the current schedule date.If Occurrence is selected, OpCon will look for the job on the numbered occurrence of the schedule. JobB depends on JobA from yesterday's schedule, or if there were holidays in between - the last time Job A was on the schedule).The Calendar Days option would not meet this need because of the holiday requirement. With calendar days on a 5-day work week, the Tuesday through Friday jobs would resolve properly to the previous calendar day. However, the job on Monday would be looking for JobA on Sunday because it is one Calendar Day back.This customer should choose to use the Occurrence option for job dependency offset calculation. OpCon will look back to the last occurrence of Job A before "today", thus resolving properly for Monday through Friday on a 5-day schedule. Valid values are Calendar Days and Occurrence.|
|Alternate Odd and Even Weeks|False|Y|The alternate to the Odd/Even Weeks frequency is Every Other Week. By setting the Server Option "Alternate Odd and Even Weeks" to "True," jobs using the Odd/Even Weeks frequency will be treated as Every Other Week frequency.|
|Number of Runs Included in Job Average Calculations|10|Y|Defines the number of most recent job history records to use when SAM Calculates Job Averages. Valid values range from 1 to 999.|
|SAM Calculates Job Averages|False|Y|Determines if SAM calculates job start and run time averages after each job run. If this value is set to True:SAM calculates the average times the way the SMA_JOBAVG stored procedure does. For more information, refer to SMA_JOBAVG in the Database Information online help. SAM passes the following parameters for the calculation: SW1: The value from Server Options for Number of Runs Included in Job Average Calculations.SW2: 1SW3: 2SW4: The Schedule Name for the job that just ran.SW5: The Job Name that just ranSpecial: SAM passes a special parameter for the Frequency of the job that just ran.The job start and run time averages will only be recalculated for jobs that are in use in the Daily. This will keep the times more current, but may cause slight processing delays in SAM depending on the job processing load. If this value is set to False, set up the job SMA JOB AVERAGE on the SMAUtility schedule to run once per day. For more information, refer to SMA Job Average. Valid values are True and False.|
|Remove Period in Abbreviated Months and Days|False|Y|SAM will check this setting for resolving Tokens that contain abbreviated months and abbreviated days.

If this option is activated, the following events cause the restart of a completed schedule:$JOB:ADD$JOB:RESTART$JOB:RESCHEDULE. By default, the SAM does not restart a completed schedule and logs the event as an error in the Critical.log. When this option is activated, the SAM restarts a schedule to allow events to process if they are received after a schedule is completed. Valid values are True and False.|
|Failed jobs should keep the Schedule "In Process"|False|Y|This parameter configures the SAM to keep schedules In Process that contain Failed jobs and Marked Failed jobs. By default, the SAM closes a schedule when all jobs are in one of the following job status categories: Cancelled, Skipped, Finished OK, or Failed. Refer to Jobs Status Change Commands.

|Hour of each day SAM should detect Schedules to build|0|Y|By default, at midnight the SAM detects schedules to build. Valid values range from 0 to 23. The hours are based on a 24-hour format starting from 0 (midnight) to 23 (11 p.m.). The SAM only processes the builds once per day. If this hour changes after the build process, SAM does not consider this parameter until the next day. Set specific times for individual schedules to build on the schedule definitions. For more information, refer to Schedule Maintenance. Note: To enable notification for failed schedule build processes, define OpCon events on the SMA_SKD_BUILD job on the AdHoc schedule. SMA Technologies provides template jobs for AdHoc with the AdHoc.mdb file. For more information, refer to SMA_SKD Jobs on the AdHoc Schedule.|
|Minutes between checking running jobs|5|Y|This parameter determines the maximum time period for the SAM to wait before inquiring about job status.SAM only inquires about the job status if SMANetCom has not received a valid message from the LSAM in the configured amount of time. When jobs are processing, the status responses update the timestamp of the last time the SAM received job information. For short jobs, there is no need for the SAM to request job status. If the SAM does not receive a status for the job within the specified time-out value, it requests the job status. This timer is necessary for jobs that run for long periods of time. It is also necessary for possible losses in communication between SMANetCom and the LSAM. If job-processing issues are suspected, set this timer to three minutes for debugging. When finished debugging, set the timer back to five minutes. If all is running well, this timer can be increased to a recommended maximum of 10 minutes. Valid values range from 1 to 1440. Note: Jobs in a "Start Attempted" status are not subject to this timer because they are checked in as timely a fashion as possible.|
|Seconds SAM should wait between PreRun attempts|180|Y|This parameter determines the amount of time in seconds between prerun attempts. By default, the SAM re-attempts prerun jobs every 180 seconds (3 minutes) until the job succeeds. Valid values range from 0 to 32000.|
