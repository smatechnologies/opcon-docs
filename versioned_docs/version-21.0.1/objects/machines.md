# Machines

All systems with LSAMs installed must be defined as a machine in the
OpCon database. Once a machine is defined in
the database, the SAM and supporting services can begin scheduling jobs
on it.

The following information applies to defining machines:

- **Name**: Defines the official host name or alias of the machine
    where the LSAM is installed. The machine name must be resolvable to
    a TCP/IP address. For additional information, refer to [Machine Name Resolution](#Machine).
- **Documentation**: Provides an area for descriptions, explanations,
    and notes that can be updated for the defined machine.
     in the **Enterprise Manager** online help.
- **Machine Type**: Defines the type of LSAM (Agent) being defined.
- **Socket Number**: Defines the socket (port number) for
    communication with the LSAM. The socket number must match the one
    configured on the machine where the LSAM was installed.
- **Max Concurrent Jobs (Server)**: This field shows the number of
    maximum jobs allowed by the OpCon server.
  - If this value is smaller than the Max Concurrent Jobs (Agent),
        the SAM will use this value to determine the max.
  - A value of zero (0) indicates that the Max Concurrent Jobs is
        controlled by the Agent.
- **Advanced Settings**: The advanced settings for a machine determine
    specific communication, logging, Available Properties, and SMA File
    Transfer settings. For complete information, refer to [Advanced Machine Configuration](#Advanced).
- **Communication Status**: Determines if SMANetCom should be
    communicating with the defined machine. If communication is started,
    SMANetCom attempts communication with the LSAM.
- **Job Starts**: Determines if the SAM should send job     start information to the LSAM. While the primary purpose of an LSAM
    is to start jobs, LSAMs also have the ability to send external
    OpCon events. If the condition exists
    where new job starts should not be initiated on the LSAM, but
    external OpCon events should still
    process, Job Starts can be disabled.
- **Machine Group Assignment**: Defines the machine groups for the
    machine. The machine group must be defined prior to assigning it to
    the machine. For additional information, refer to [Machine Groups](./machine-groups.md).

## Machine Name Resolution

For the SMANetCom to communicate with an LSAM to run jobs, the Machine
name in the database must resolve to a TCP/IP address. Consequently, the
machine name must match either a host name recognized by the DNS server
or a TCP/IP address must be manually configured.

The following information provides different methods for associating a
TCP/IP address with the OpCon machine name:

- The DNS server (For information on configuring a DNS server, contact
    the network administrator.)
- Assign the TCP/IP address to the machine through the advanced
    configuration options in OpCon. For
    additional information, refer to [Communication Settings](#Communic).
- The hosts file on the OpCon application
    server. For additional information, refer to **[Configure the Hosts     File on the OpCon Application
    Server](#Configure_the_Hosts_File_on_the__Application_Server)
    ** section.

:::note
To confirm name resolution for DNS or hosts file configuration, ping the machine by name from the OpCon application server.
:::

### Configure the Hosts File on the OpCon Application Server

Complete the following procedure on the OpCon
application server:

1. Right-click **Start** on the **Windows** task bar and select
    **Explore** from the menu.
2. Browse to the **<Windows Directory\>\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\**
    directory.
3. Right-click the **hosts** file and select **Open With**.
4. Select an **ASCII text editor** (e.g., Notepad) in the **Choose the
    program you want use** list.
5. Insert *a new line* below the last line containing a TCP/IP address.
6. Type the *TCP/IP address* for the **MCP LSAM** machine.
7. Click the key.
8. Type the *Hostname alias* as it is entered in the Enterprise
    Manager.
9. Use menu path: **File \> Save**.
10. Open a command prompt and ping the machine by name to confirm the
    connection (e.g., ping Servername).

## Advanced Machine Configuration

Advanced Machine Configuration contains machine parameters, parameter
values, and whether each value is from the system (default) or is
user-defined. The default value for each setting is functional for most
LSAMs; however, consult the platform-specific LSAM documentation for
detailed information. An asterisk (\*) may appear in front of some of
the values -- this indicates that the value is not the default value. If
an asterisk appears in front, then after the value is displayed, the
default value is shown in parentheses (Default). Refer to [Configuring Advanced Machine Parameters and
Properties](../Files/UI/Enterprise-Manager/Configuring-Advanced-Machine-Properties.md)
 in the **Enterprise Manager** online help.

### Communication Settings

- **Fully Qualified Domain Name** (Optional): Defines the Fully
    Qualified Domain Name of the machine to configure communication
    using this name instead of the Machine Name.
  - SMANetCom and the LSAMDataRetriever first use the Fully
        Qualified Domain Name for communication if it is specified. If
        not specified, they look for a TCP/IP address. If that is not
        specified, they use the Machine Name for communication.
  - There is no validation on the text, and up to 4000 characters
        are allowed.
- **TCP/IP Address** (Optional): Defines the TCP/IP address of the
    LSAM machine. This definition discontinues the conversion of a
    machine name to a TCP/IP address by the Host file or by DNS.
  - If specified, this field requires a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
- **SMA NetCom Identifier** (Optional): Defines a unique SMANetCom
    name to the LSAM. To increase bandwidth for very large
    installations, an OpCon administrator may
    configure multiple instances of SMANetCom.
- **SMA Communications Protocol**: Defines the method by which
    SMANetCom communicates with the LSAM. This setting is a read-only
    parameter for informational purposes. Only the platform-specific
    data migration script can change the value. Values include:
  - Legacy, Non-XML
  - Contemporary, Non-XML
  - Contemporary, XML

**Use TLS for Scheduling Communications**: The default for this
parameter is FALSE. Specify TRUE when this machine should use TLS
Security.

**TLS Certificate Distinguished Name**: If specified, this name must
match the server name on the certificate installed on the machine where
this agent resides. If this field is left blank, then the name on the
certificate is assumed to be either the fully qualified domain name
(FQDN) of the agent machine, if specified in the machine's settings, or
the "OpCon" machine name for the agent, if the FQDN is not specified.
For more information, refer to [Validation of the Digital Certificate Distinguished Name](../server-programs/network-communications.md#validati)
 in the **Server Programs**Â online help.

**TLS Certificate Serial Number**: An identifier for the LSAM
certificate, optionally (refer below) required only when the LSAM uses a
self-signed certificate to identify itself to OpCon. This number can be
found in the certificate store of the actual operating system where the
LSAM software is installed. When the TLS Certificate Serial Number will
be used, the self-signed certificate must be installed into the
Microsoft Windows certificate store of the OpCon server because OpCon
cannot use one of the locally stored Certificate Authority certificates
to validate the LSAM's self-signed certificate. The serial number
provides the key that OpCon programs use to read the local copy of the
self-signed certificate.\
\

This field is optional if any of the following is true:

1. The servername on the certificate matches the FQDN (fully qualified
    domain name) that was registered in the machine record
2. The servername on the certificate matches the machine name defined
    in Opcon
3. The servername on the certificate matches the "TLS Certificate
    Distinguished Name" that was registered in the machine record

**Check Certificate Revocation List**: The default for this parameter is
FALSE. If TRUE, then connection to the LSAM will fail if its certificate
has been revoked. Please refer to Microsoft Windows documentation for
procedures required to maintain a certification revocation list on the
OpCon server machine.

**Gateway** (Optional): Defines a machine to relay messages between
SMANetCom and other LSAM machines.

- Only machines that have the same SMA Communications Protocol can be
    assigned to this parameter.
- This parameter only applies to the z/OS, OS 2200, and BIS platforms.

:::caution
Unless requested by SMA Technologies, do not change this value.
:::

**JORS Port Number** (Optional): Defines the port that the Job Output
Retrieval System (JORS) service monitors for job output. This port
number must match the JORS port number configured on the LSAM
configuration. For additional information, refer to the LSAM online help
for the desired platform. For more information on the JORS Port Number
and viewing job output, refer to [Viewing a Job Output File](../operations/job-output.md#Viewing).

  - Java
  - MCP
  - OS 2200
  - SAP BW
  - SAP R/3
  - SQL
  - Tuxedo ART
  - UNIX
  - Windows (MSLSAM only)
  - z/OS
- Valid values range from 1024 to 32767
- Default value is '0' (a value of zero disables the feature).

**Requires XML Escape Sequences**: Determines if the SAM converts
reserved characters (e.g., "<", "\>", "&", etc.) before sending
messages to an LSAM.

- If True, the reserved characters are converted.

- If False (default), the reserved characters are not converted.

- **Check CRC**: Determines if all LSAM-SMANetCom messages are checked
    for the SMA Technologies proprietary digital     signature. With the default value of True, messages are checked. Set
    the value to False to disable the feature.
- **Close Socket During Synchronization**: Determines if SMANetCom
    will close the socket after its initial message with the LSAM.
    Synchronization between SMANetCom and the LSAM occurs more
    efficiently when the socket settings are the same for both. The
    default value of False determines that the socket will remain open.
    Set the value to False to close the connection after initial
    communication.

### Logging

- **TraceAllMessages**: Determines if all LSAM-SMANetCom messages are
    traced. With the default value of True, messages are traced. Set the
    value to False to reduce the amount of logging by suppressing both
    the outbound poll messages (TX9s) and the "No messages waiting"
    (-) messages.

### Time Settings

- **Time Zone Name**: Defines the local time zone name on the LSAM
    system where the Machine physically exists. This value will only
    appear if the LSAM supports the ability to send the information.
  - Value example: CST
- **Time Offset from UTC (hours)**: Defines the local time zone offset
    from UTC in hours formatted as HH.MM in decimal format to provide
    half (.5) and quarter hour (.25) offsets. This value will only
    appear if the LSAM supports the ability to send the information.
  - Value example: 06.00
- **Connection Attempt Timeout (ms)**: Defines in milliseconds how
    long SMANetCom attempts to connect to an LSAM. If an LSAM does not
    respond during this time, SMANetCom discontinues connection attempts
    and the graphical interfaces report the machine as "down".
  - Valid values range from 1000 (Default) to 60000 milliseconds.
- **Time Offset from SAM (hours)**: Defines a read-only setting that
    shows the calculated value of the difference between the Machine's
    time and SAM's time. This field only appears if the machine has
    Time Zone Name and Time Offset from UTC (hours) configured, AND the
    SAM has stored its Time Zone Name and Offset from UTC in the
    database.
- **Poll Interval (ms)**: Defines in milliseconds how frequently
    SMANetCom requests messages (known as a TX9 message) from the LSAM.
  - Valid values range from 500 to 60000 milliseconds.
  - Default value: 1000
- **Check Machine Status (sec)**: Defines in seconds how frequently
    SMANetCom requests machine status (known as a TX4 message) from the
    LSAM.
  - Valid values range from 60 to 300 seconds.
  - Default value: 120
- **Response Timeout (sec)**: Defines in seconds how long SMANetCom
    waits for a response after polling the LSAM (known as a TX9
    message). SMANetCom drops the connection if the LSAM does not
    respond within this time period; nevertheless, SMANetCom attempts
    reconnection.
  - Valid values range from 30 (Default) to 600 seconds.
- **Consecutive Send Sleep Time (ms)**: Defines in milliseconds the wait time between blocks.
  - Valid values range from 100 (Default) to 60000 milliseconds.

### Buffer Settings

- **MaxConsecutiveSend Messages**: Defines the maximum number of
    outbound messages (i.e., a block) to a single LSAM that SMANetCom
    sends before waiting. The maximum and wait time (refer to the
    [Consecutive Send Sleep Time     (ms)](#Consecutive_Send_Sleep_Time_(ms)) parameter) allow the
    operating system to efficiently manage the outbound TCP/IP stack.
  - Valid values range from 0 to 500 messages.
  - Default value: 100
- **Send BufferCount**: Defines the number of outbound TCP/IP buffers
    to allocate for the LSAM connection. The size of one TCP/IP buffer
    is 8192 bytes.
  - Valid values range from 10 to 100 buffers.
  - Default value: 25
- **Receive BufferCount**: Defines the number of inbound TCP/IP
    buffers to allocate for the LSAM connection. The size of one TCP/IP
    buffer is 8192 bytes.
  - Valid values range from 10 to 100 buffers.
  - Default value: 25
