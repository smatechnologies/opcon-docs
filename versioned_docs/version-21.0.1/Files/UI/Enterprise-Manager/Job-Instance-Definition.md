# Job Instance Definition

The **Instance Definition** tab in the [**Job Master**](Using-Job-Master.md) editor allows you to define and manage job instance properties. Within the tab, you will be able to:

- [Define Properties for Single Instance Jobs](Defining-Properties-for-Single-Instance-Jobs.md)
- [Define Properties for Multi-Instance Jobs](Defining-Properties-for-Multi-Instance-Jobs.md)
- [Update Job Instance Properties](Updating-Job-Instance-Properties.md)
- [Delete Job Instance Properties](Deleting-Job-Instance-Properties.md)

For conceptual information, refer to [Instance Definition](../../../job-components/instances.md) in the **Concepts** online help.
