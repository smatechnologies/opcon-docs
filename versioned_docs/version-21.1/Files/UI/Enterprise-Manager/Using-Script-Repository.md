# Using Script Repository

The **Script Repository** editor is designed to provide a way to store
job scripts in the OpCon database. These scripts can be sent to any
Agent machine that supports the
[runner](Managing-Script-Runners.md) for that script. For more
information about this concept, refer to [Embedded Scripts](../../../automation-concepts/embedded-scripts.md) in the
**Concepts**Â online help.

In the Script Repository, you can:

- Browse a host file system to select and import a script file
- Edit and update the content of a script
- Create versions of a script so that the correct version can be
    associated with a job
- Delete a script or any versions of a script

## Script Repository Toolbar

The toolbar resides at the top-right corner of the screen. Click on any
specific icon on the toolbar below to learn more about its
functionality.

## Right-Click Menu

Right-clicking on a script in the editor opens a menu that provides the
same options as the toolbar.
