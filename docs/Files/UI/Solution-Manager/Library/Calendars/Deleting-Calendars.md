# Deleting Calendars

:::note
SMA Technologies recommends deleting user-defined calendars that are no longer in use. This helps control the size of the tables in the database. Holiday calendars are automatically deleted if the associated schedule is deleted.
:::

Calendars may be deleted if they are not being used. To determine if a calendar is in use, select the calendar and click the **Edit** button. The **Calendar** dialog displays. The **CALENDAR ASSOCIATIONS** tab indicates the number of schedules, jobs and frequencies that use the selected calendar. To view a list of the schedules, jobs or frequencies that use the calendar, click the **CALENDAR ASSOCIATIONS** tab.

To delete calendar(s):

1. Select the calendar(s) to delete from the list of existing calendars.
2. A confirmation dialog displays. Click **Yes** to delete the selected calendar(s) or click **No** to cancel the deletion.
