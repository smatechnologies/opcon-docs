# Tags

*Tags* are labels or bookmarks you can create to group jobs based on business needs. Schedules are typically organized by process flow. Tags enable you to filter jobs whose process flow has nothing to do with each other but have something specific in common.

:::tip Example

- Tag each Job by the program name. This way you can easily see all Job using that program.
- Tag each job by the Global Properties it uses. This will allow you to find all jobs associated with a Global Property before updating its value.
- Tag each job by severity. This will allow you to see if any Jobs marked as "Critical" have failed. (Critical, High, Low, Maintenance)
- Tag each job by department. You can already filter Jobs by Department, but those departments also come with Department Level Privileges if you do not want to set the privileges but want the sorting capability tags can be used.
- Tag by job purpose. This will allow you to see jobs necessary to conform to Governmental Regulation, Company Policies, Vender Requirements, and so forth.
