# Viewing Notification Acknowledgement

The **Notification Acknowledgement** page is used to view and acknowledge escalations. For more conceptual information, refer to [Escalation](../../../notifications/Escalation.md) in the **Concepts** online help.

When on the **Notification Acknowledgement** screen, it lists any escalations that have not been acknowledged. The screen shows the following information for each escalation:

- **Date & Time**: The date and time of the escalation.
- **Notification**: The subject of the email notification pending acknowledgment.
- **Escalation Level**: The current level of the escalation, as defined in the rule sequence.
- **Status**: The current state of the escalation's acknowledgment. Status has three states:
  - **Pending**: An escalation is awaiting acknowledgment and has been sent to one or more groups of users who are part of the escalation rule.
  - **Exhausted**: An escalation has been sent to all groups of users in the rule, but has not been acknowledged.
  - **Acknowledged**: An escalation has been acknowledged. The notification will soon automatically disappear after acknowledgment.
