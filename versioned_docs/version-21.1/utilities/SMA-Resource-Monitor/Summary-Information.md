# Summary Information

The SMA Resource Monitor User Interface is used to create and manage
File Monitors, Counter Monitors, Service Monitors, Process Monitors and
Action Groups.

- An **Active** checkbox displays for every monitor type tab and the
    Action Groups tab. Place a checkmark inside the checkbox to activate
    a Monitor or Action Group. Unselect the checkbox to deactivate the
    Monitor or Action Group.
- Within each tab, click on the column headers to sort information in
    ascending or descending order.
- On each Monitor tab, when a specific **Monitor Name** is clicked,
    the Monitor Information screen shows *Monitor Details* and *Action
    Details* to provide information about the monitor and the actions
    that take place when the rule is met.
- The Action Groups tab shows actions that will take place when the
    Action Group is triggered. Action groups can be associated with any
    monitor type. Additionally, any change to an action group applies to
    all monitors associated with it.
