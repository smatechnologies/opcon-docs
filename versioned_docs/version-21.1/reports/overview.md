# OpCon Reporting

OpCon has [Predefined Reports](./predefined.md) to aid in gathering information on the status of OpCon. In addition to the predefined reports, new reports can be generated by accessing the database directly using the BIRT Report Designer (you can download the "All-in-One" release from [http://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/](http://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/).

If a new report is created, it can be integrated into the database using the Report Management utility. Refer to [Using Report Management](../Files/UI/Enterprise-Manager/Using-Report-Management.md) in the **Enterprise Manager** online help.
