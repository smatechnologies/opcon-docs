:::note
As a security measure, some users may be presented with a Security message after each manual login or attempt to access the application via automatic login. Those users must Accept or Decline this message. If accepted, then the user may proceed as normal to access the features and data in the application. If declined, then the user will either be returned to the login screen or presented with the security message.

The Security message is configured under the Generals tab of the Server Options editor in the Enterprise Manager. For more information about security message configuration, refer to the [Login Security Message](../../../administration/server-options.md#general) parameter in the Concepts online help.

### Automatic Login

Solution Manager supports automatic login when Windows Authentication is turned on.

First, make sure you have configured users in OpCon for Automatic Login using the Enterprise Manager.

:::note
The user in the Enterprise Manager needs to include the Windows Domain and Username.

If the automatic logon fails, then the login screen will display so that you can provide the OpCon account credentials.

### Windows Authentication Login

The **Login with Windows** button is available to allow you to log into the application using Windows Authentication and bypass entering OpCon login credentials. When activated, your Windows credentials are sent to the server for authentication.

In order for the button to display on the login screen, you will need to ensure that a few settings are configured.

- **Enable Windows Authentication** option should be enabled in the **Server Options** editor in the Enterprise Manager. Alternatively, Windows Authentication can be enabled by the API.
- **Windows Pass-Through Authentication** should be enabled in the [Application Settings](Configuring-Application-Settings.md) in the Solution Manager.

### Session Expiration

Should the browser session expire, a pop-up window will display to allow you to log back into the application without having to go to the login screen. Depending on how you initially logged in, the pop-up will either prompt for your login credentials or display the **Login with Windows** button.
