3. Select an OpCon **Event Template** to start defining event details. 
:::note
The **Event Template** drop-down contains several Administrative Events for advanced operations. For more information on these type of events, refer to [Administrative Events](../../../events/types.md#Administ) in the **OpCon Events** online help.
:::
  * Once you choose a template, the screen dynamically changes to provide UI assistance for filling out the event details.
  * A preview of the defined Event displays below the **Event Template drop-down**in the dark grey box.
  * The variable(s) will be resolved before the Event is sent to OpCon.
:::note
You can use the **Manual Edit** button (pencil icon) to define an Event manually.Â **Manual Edit** can also be used to edit an Event that was defined using the **Event Template** option, as shown in the example graphic.

4. Complete the **Event definition**.
5. Click the **OK** button to apply your changes and return to the **Service Request definition** page. You can also select the **Cancel** button to discard the Event changes.

### Using Variables

* You can specify variables in your Events by using the syntax ```${variable name}```
* You can use the same variable multiple times in the same Event, as well as in other Events for the same Service Request. 
  * If you do this, the variable will appear as only one User Input. 
  * This means that the one value the user supplies will be used for every instance of that variable.
* You have the option to use the following system variables specifically in Solution Manager:
  * **${SM.USER.LOGIN}** - Resolves to the Name defined for the OpCon user who clicked the Service Request button.
  * **${SM.USER.NAME}** - Resolves to the Full User Name defined for the OpCon user who clicked the Service Request button.
  * **${SM.USER.EMAIL}** - Resolves to the Email Address defined for the OpCon user who clicked the Service Request button.
  * **${SM.USER.COMMENTS}** - Resolves to the Comments defined for the OpCon user who clicked the Service Request button.
