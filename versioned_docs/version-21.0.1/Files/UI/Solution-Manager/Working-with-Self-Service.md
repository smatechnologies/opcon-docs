# Working with Self Service

SMA Technologies' flagship product, OpCon, is a comprehensive cross-platform workload automation solution. Self Service
is a licensed module for OpCon in SMA Technologies' next-generation web interface. It
is an innovative solution that empowers front-office staff to trigger
OpCon workflows without having to engage the IT department.

## License File Request and Storing

If you have purchased the Self Service solution, you will need a license to see and access it in this version of Solution

procedures.

To request the license file:

1. Launch Enterprise Manager.
2. Use menu path: **Help \> About OpCon EnterpriseManager**.
3. Click the **License Information** tab.
4. Select the **System ID** \[e.g., (OpconServer_6410)\] at the end of     the first line.
5. Right-click and select **Copy**.
6. Send an email to <license@smatechnologies.com> to request an updated
    license file for OpCon that includes support for "SMA Self Service"
    and paste the System ID into the email request. You should receive
    the license within an hour during regular business hours.
7. Click **OK** to close the **About** dialog.

After SMA Technologies responds to the license request, follow this next procedure to save the license file to the SAM
directory.

To save the license file:

1. Save the file to the **<Configuration
    Directory\>\\OpConxps\\SAM\\** folder on your OpCon server when you
    receive your license file from SMA Technologies. SAM will automatically pick up
    this new file within 6 hours.
2. *(Optional)* Stop and restart the **SMA OpCon
    Service Manager** in your **Windows Services** tool to pick up the
    file immediately.
