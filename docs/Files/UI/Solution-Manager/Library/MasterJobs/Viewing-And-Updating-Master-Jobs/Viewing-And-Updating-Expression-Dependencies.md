# Viewing and Updating Expression Dependencies

The **Expression Dependency** panel in **Master Job Definition** displays the
expression dependencies relating to the job and frequencies of the job.

- The panel can be placed in **Full Screen** mode by simply clicking
  the icon (![Full Screen Panel Icon     ](../../../../../../Resources/Images/SM/Full-Screen-Mode-Icon.png "Full Screen Panel Icon"))
  to the far-right side of the panel bar. Escape **Full Screen** mode
  by clicking on the icon again.
- When the panel contains defined properties, a blue circular
  indicator containing a number (![Job Properties     Indicator](../../../../../../Resources/Images/SM/Daily-Job-Definition-Properties-Indicator.png "Job Properties Indicator"))
  will appear to the right of the panel name to indicate the number of
  properties that have been defined.
