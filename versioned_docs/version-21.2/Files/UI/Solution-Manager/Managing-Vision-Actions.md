# Managing Vision Actions

Vision Actions are OpCon Events defined for a Vision Frequency Trigger.

The following fields apply for setting Vision Actions:

- **Name**: This field allows you to define the event name.
- **Events:** This field displays a list of Events defined for the
    Action and allows you to add, edit, or delete an Action. Clicking
    the Add button will open the Create new Event window containing the
    Event Template drop-down.
  - **Event Template**: This drop-down allows you to select an event
        template. Once you choose a template, the screen dynamically
        changes to provide UI assistance for filling out the event
        details.

## Using the Vision Action Admin Page

The **Vision Actions** page is the central location where you can view
all existing actions as well as add, edit, and delete actions.
