# Departments

Departments can be used to secure function privileges associated with individual job records. The department object is simply a name. To make use of a department, function privileges must be granted (refer to [OpCon User Account and Role Management](../administration/privileges.md#departmental-function-privileges)), and the access code must be associated with the jobs needing this type of security (refer to [Jobs](../objects/jobs.md)). A single department can be used to secure as many different jobs as necessary.

The following information applies to defining departments:

- **Name**: Defines the name for the defined department.
- **Documentation**: Provides an area for descriptions, explanations,
    and notes that can be updated for the department.
