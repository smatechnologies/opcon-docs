# Expression Dependency

The **Expression Dependency** tab allows you to define and maintain job
dependencies on expressions using the Property Expressions API. Within
the tab, you will be able to:

- [Add Expression     Dependencies](Adding-Expression-Dependencies.md)
- [Edit Expression     Dependencies](Editing-Expression-Dependencies.md)
- [Delete Expression     Dependencies](Deleting-Expression-Dependencies.md)

For conceptual information, refer to [Property Expressions API Syntax](../../../reference/property-expressions-syntax.md)
 in the **Concepts** online help. For examples and use cases,
refer to the [Use Cases](../../../reference/property-expressions-syntax.md#Use)
 section.
