# Using Escalation Manager

The **Escalation Manager** editor is used to define
escalation rules for any ENS trigger that uses email. User-defined
escalation user groups are created and assigned to escalation rules.
 rules are applied to triggers in [Notification
Definitions](Notification-Definitions.md) in **Notification
Manager**. For all conceptual information regarding the Event
Notification System (ENS), refer to [Event Notification](../../../notifications/Components.md) in
the **Concepts** online help.

When on the **Escalation Manager** screen, it displays
escalation rules and groups.

**Escalation Manager** also provides a **Type Filter Text** box for
rules and groups in order to type a part of or the full name for the
specific item to display the selection. You can also type an \*
(asterisk) in front of a word in a string if the string you are looking
for is not necessarily at the beginning of the string.

:::note
In the Escalation Manager screen, type **Level** to find a specific rule or group includes "Level" somewhere in the string.
