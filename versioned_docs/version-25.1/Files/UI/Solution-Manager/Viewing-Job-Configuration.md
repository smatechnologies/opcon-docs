# Viewing Job Configuration

The **Operations** module allows you to retrieve the configuration for
a job if it:

- is completed or has started
- does not have a status of Waiting, On Hold, Cancelled, Missed
    Start Time, or Skipped

To view job configuration:

Click on the **Failed**, **Running**, or **Completed** operation dial or
use the **Quick Search** field (type the keyword and click **Enter**) in
the **Jobs** section on the **Operations Summary** page.

The **Processes** page will display.

Select one **job** in the list. A record of your selection will display
in the [status bar](SM-UI-Layout.md#Status) at the bottom of the
page in the form of a breadcrumb trail.

Click on the job record (e.g., 1 job(s)) in the status bar to display
the **Selection** panel.

The Configuration tab allows an overarching view into the configuration of your daily job details with information regarding operations details, manual status changes, job time details, retry and recurrence information, and additional information based on the job type. Fields without a value will display \<None\> and fields that are user defined will have this icon: !["User defined" icon](../../../Resources/Images/user-defined-icon.png "User defined icon"){ width=25 }
