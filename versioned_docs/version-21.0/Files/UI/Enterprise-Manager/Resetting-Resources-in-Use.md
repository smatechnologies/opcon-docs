# Resetting Resources in Use

:::note
SAM is responsible for keeping track of the resources in use. If all resources are in use, the SAM waits until a resource is available before submitting the next job.
:::

If something unusual has occurred, and the "Resources in Use" value in
incorrect, the EM provides a button to allow an administrator to fix the
value. You should only use this feature if you are completely sure that
the value is inaccurate.

:::note
If the Resources in Use is reduced while jobs are still using the Resource, there is a strong possibility that OpCon will exceed the defined resource maximum.
:::
