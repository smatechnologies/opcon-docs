        an interval- or size-driven trigger with these settings:

    - **Interval (s)**: This option allows you to configure the
            logs to be sent at a certain time interval (from 0 to 600
            seconds).

            configure the logs to be sent on the accumulated max
            character size limit (from 0 to 5000 characters).

        trigger with these settings:
