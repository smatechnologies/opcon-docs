# Viewing and Updating Documentation

The **Documentation** panel in **Daily Job Definition** displays the
documentation relating to the job and frequency of the job and may
include hyperlinks that are clickable in **Read-only** mode.

- The panel can be placed in **Full Screen** mode by simply clicking
    the icon (![Full Screen Panel Icon     ](../../../Resources/Images/SM/Full-Screen-Mode-Icon.png "Full Screen Panel Icon"))
    to the far-right side of the panel bar. Escape **Full Screen** mode
    by clicking on the icon again.
- When the panel contains defined properties, a blue circular
    indicator containing a number (![Job Properties     Indicator](../../../Resources/Images/SM/Daily-Job-Definition-Properties-Indicator.png "Job Properties Indicator"))
    will appear to the right of the panel name to indicate the number of
    properties that have been defined.
