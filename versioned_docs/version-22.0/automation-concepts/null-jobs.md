# Null Jobs

The Null job provides a way to generate OpCon
events and/or set thresholds without having to run a job.

- Null jobs are set up like any other job, except the **Job Type** is
    set to Null.
- Apart from the fact that no Job-specific details are associated with
    it, a Null job is identical to other jobs (i.e., all job automation
    components can be associated with it).
- A Null job always finishes **OK** as soon as it starts.

Examples of Null job use are to:

- Keep schedules open
- Initialize thresholds at a specific point in a schedule
- Send notifications
