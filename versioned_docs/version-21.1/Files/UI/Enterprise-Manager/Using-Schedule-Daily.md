# Using Schedule Daily

The **Schedule Daily** editor displays a drop-down list of schedule
dates and schedules. Once the specific schedule date and schedule is
selected, schedule details and events can be modified. For conceptual
information on editing daily schedules, refer to [Editing Daily Schedules](../../../operations/editing-schedules.md)
 in the **Concepts** online help.

:::note
If a completed schedule contains failed jobs, it will show in red by default (this is the default failed color for failed jobs) with the text like this: ScheduleName (Completed -- Contains Failed Jobs). If the schedule is still in progress, but contains failed jobs, it will look like this: ScheduleName (In Progress -- Contains Failed Jobs).
