# Overview

Skills are a way to perform specific tasks in OpCon directly via the Otto chatbot. Skills are designed to help users execute tasks in OpCon without having to navigate through the OpCon UI. Each skill is mapped to a specific api endpoint in OpCon and can be executed by directly asking Otto to perform the task. Each skill is defined in the OpCon API documentation.

## Accessing Skills

To access and execute a specific skill, ask Otto to perform the task. If the skill is available and enabled, Otto will respond with a confirmation message before executing the task. If the skill is not available/enabled or if the skill failed to execute successfully, Otto will respond with an error message.
