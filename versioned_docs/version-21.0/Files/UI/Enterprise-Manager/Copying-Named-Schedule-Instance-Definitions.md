#  Copying Named Schedule Instance Definitions

Enterprise Manager allows users to replicate named instance details
across other named instances. With Copy functionality, you can replace
any existing properties or exceptions in one instance (target) with
those from another (source).

To copy named instance definitions:

1.  Double-click on **Schedule Master** under the **Administration**
    topic. The **Schedule Master** screen displays.
2.  Select the **schedule** in the **Schedule Selection** drop-down
    list.
3.  Click on the **Instance Definition** tab in the **Schedule Details**
    frame.
4.  Double-click on the **instance name** that is the source of the
    definitions that you wish to copy.
5.  Select the target **named instance(s)** from the **Instance(s) to
    Replace** field.
6.  Select the **Replace Properties** and/or **Replace Exceptions**
    radio button(s) to specify which named instance details that you
    wish to replicate to the target instance(s).
7.  Click the **OK** button.
8.  Click ![Green circle with white checkmark     inside](../../../Resources/Images/EM/EMsave.png "Save icon")
    **Save** on the **Schedule Master** toolbar to confirm the deletion.
9.  Click **Close ☒** (to the right of the **Schedule Master** tab) to
    close the **Schedule Master** screen.
