# Navigation Views

In the Enterprise Manager, the Navigation Views (e.g., Workflow Designer, Daily Maintenance, Daily List, Matrix Chart, Gantt
Chart, PERT View, Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Workload Chart, Machine Status)
support the editors by providing a visual representations for the editor
information. Any number of views can be opened at the same time, but
only one can be active at any one time.

Unlike Editors, Views can be [dragged out of the workspace to another separate area](#Moving) on their own.

## Opening Navigation Views

To perform the procedure:

1. Click on the arrow to expand a Navigation topic in the [Navigation     Panel](Navigation-Panel.md) to the left of the screen.
2. Double-click on the **Navigation View**(e.g., **Workflow
    Designer**).
3. *(Optional)* Click on and drag the **Navigation
    View** tab onto the tab bar if not already attached.
4. Repeat Step 2 to open more views.

## Changing Navigation View Tab Order

Click on and drag then release the specific **Navigation View** tab that
needs to be moved to the new location on the tab bar.

:::note
A stack symbol (![Three white folders with black borders stacked](../../../Resources/Images/EM/stacked-folders.png "Stacked icon")) will appear as you drag the view over other view tabs.

## Arranging Navigation Views

To perform the procedure:

1. Click on and drag the specific **Navigation View** tab in the
    direction where you want the editor to display (e.g., drag the tab
    to the left, right, top, or bottom of screen).
2. Release the **Navigation View** tab once the stack symbol has
    changed to the arrow symbol. The **Navigation View** will drop into
    place.

## Moving Navigation Views of the Workspace Frame

To perform the procedure:

1. Click on and drag the specific **Navigation View** tab outside of
    the Enterprise Manager workspace area (e.g., if you have a dual
    monitor workspace, the **Navigation View** can be dragged to the
    second monitor).
2. Release the **Navigation View** tab in the preferred location
    outside of the workspace area.

Alternatively, you can right-click on the **Navigation View** tab and
select **Detached**. Then drag the detached view to the preferred
location outside of the workspace area.

## Returning Navigation Views to the Workspace Frame

Click on and drag then release the **Navigation View** tab back to the
preferred location inside the workspace area. Alternatively, you can
right-click on the **Navigation View** tab and select **Detached**. This
will un-detach the view and return it to the Enterprise Manager
workspace.
