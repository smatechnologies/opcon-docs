# Role Users

The Roles page is found in _Library > Access Management > Roles_, and provides the views to manage Privileges and Roles. When you click on the Users tab, you will see a list of all the roles that have been created in the system. You can click on the name of a role to view the details of that role.

A series of tabs is displayed on the Roles page. The Users tab indicates the users that are assigned to the selected role. The user's Full Name, Login Name, and Email Address, if available, are displayed. The email is a clickable link that will open the logged in user's email client.

To modify the users granted to a role, edit the preferred fields and click **Save**.
