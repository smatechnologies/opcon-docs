# Access Codes

Access codes can be used to secure individual job records. The access code object is simply a name. To make use of an access code, privileges must be granted (refer to [Access Code Privileges](../administration/privileges.md#access-code-privileges)), and the access code must be associated with the jobs needing this type of security (refer to [Jobs](../objects/jobs.md)). A single access code can be used to secure as many different jobs as necessary.

The following information applies to defining access codes:

- **Name**: Defines the name for the access code.
- **Documentation**: Provides an area for descriptions and notes for the access code.
