# Information Bar

The Information Bar, located at the bottom of the Enterprise Manager screen, is always available whether you are working
with editors or views. The information that can be obtained from the
Information Bar is listed from the left to the right. In this bar, the
SAM last pulse message is visible and the user and database connection
information is available.

The Information Bar has or displays the following:

- **Escalation Acknowledgment**: This icon only appears if there are
    escalations that need to be     acknowledged. The number displayed indicates the number of pending
    acknowledgments. A yellow pop-up also flashes above the icon
    indicating pending acknowledgments. Clicking on the icon opens the
    **[Escalation     Acknowledgment](Using-Escalation-Acknowlegement.md)** screen,
    where the escalations can be     acknowledged.
- **Status Line**: This section is blank until there is status
    information to display (e.g., if the List view is opened and you
    expand a date and schedule and click on a job to highlight it, then
    the date, schedule, and job name will be displayed in the status
    line).
- **SAM Pulse**: The SAM Pulse icon has a green flash of color that
    constantly circles around the icon if SAM is in a started state. If
    the SAM service goes down, this flash of color circling the icon
    will change to red and a glowing red dot will also appear in the
    middle of the circle. Once SAM is restarted, the color will change
    back to green, and the red dot will disappear. By holding the mouse
    pointer over the SAM pulse icon, the SAM pulse date and time will be
    displayed.
- **Connection Information**: The connection information shows the
    user who is currently logged in, the server name where the SAM is
    installed, and the Database name.
- **Activity Information**: Activity information may flash on the
    right section of the Information Bar (e.g., if the Bar Chart screen
    is opening, you may refer to a message that states: *fetching bar
    chart data*.
- **Notifications**: Occasionally, when you log into the EM,
    notifications will be visible in the center above the Information
    Bar. The EM will check the license each time at login, so
    notifications could include messages relating to License
    information. You will have to acknowledge the notification. There
    will be an indication of the notification (an x in a red circle) in the Information Bar.
    Holding the mouse pointer over the red circle will cause the
    Notifications to be displayed again.
