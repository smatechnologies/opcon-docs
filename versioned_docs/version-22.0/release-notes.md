# OpCon Release Notes

## OpCon 22.0.1

2023 March

#### REST API

:white_check_mark: **OPCON-15392**: Fixed an issue where the replicated OpCon database did not have all tables reseeded for unique ids and hence had a primary key violation error when building or adding jobs to daily.

## OpCon 22.0.0

2023 February

#### NOTE: Users with large workflows may experience these performance issues in Solution Manager:

#### In environments with 60,000 jobs or more, Master Job management screens may experience increased page loading times. With schedules containing more than 500 jobs, Studio canvas may experience slow loading times or loading errors.

#### If these delays occur, the instances themselves will still run normally on the OpCon server. Weâ€™re working to address both of these issues and anticipate a fix soon after this release. We appreciate your patience as we continue to develop these new Solution Manager capabilities to bring feature parity and scalability for large workflows.

#### Installation

:eight_spoked_asterisk: **OPCON-16236**: A new OpConMFT agent (an agent dedicated to file transfers) is now available as part of OpCon installation. Please refer to the documentation available for the agent on the OpCon help site. NOTE: If you intend to use this agent, you will need to request a new license with this agent included in it. Without the license, if you try to define a new machine for this agent in OpCon and mark it up, you will see a license violation in the Critical log and core services will stop.
