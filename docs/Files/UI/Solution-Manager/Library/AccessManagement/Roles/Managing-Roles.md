# Managing Roles

The Roles page is found in Library -> Access Management -> Roles, and provides the views to manage Privileges and Roles. When you click on the Roles tab, you will see a list of all the roles that have been created in the system. You can click on the name of a role to view the details of that role.

A series of tabs is displayed on the Roles page:

- [General](Roles-General.md)
- [Activities](Roles-Activities.md)
- [Batch Users](Roles-Batch-Users.md)
- [Departments](Roles-Departments.md)
- [Resources](Roles-Resources.md)
