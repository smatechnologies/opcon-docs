# Managing Machine Groups

The **Machine Groups** editor is used to define and maintain
OpCon Machine Groups. The editor provides a
list of machine groups, the corresponding machine type, and the ability
to view and/or edit the assigned and unassigned machines. For conceptual
information, refer to [Machine Groups](../../../objects/machine-groups.md) in the
**Concepts** online help.

## Machine Groups Toolbar

The **Machine Groups** editor also has a toolbar that allows you to
perform functions for managing the machine groups. Click on any specific
icon on the toolbar below to learn more about its functionality.
