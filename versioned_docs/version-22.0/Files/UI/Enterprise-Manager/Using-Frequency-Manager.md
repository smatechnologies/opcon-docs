#  Using Frequency Manager

The **Frequency Manager** is a management tool designed to provide an
easy way to look up, edit, rename, forecast, and compare frequencies.
Duplicate frequency names and frequency definitions can be resolved, and
a quick cross-reference view of any schedules/jobs using the frequency
can also be done in the **Frequency Manager**.

 

When on the **Frequency Manager** screen, it displays a list of
frequency names and the master schedules and jobs using the frequency.

## Frequency Manager Toolbar

The **Frequency Manager** also has a toolbar that allows you to perform
functions for managing frequencies. Click on any specific icon on the
toolbar below to learn more about its functionality.
