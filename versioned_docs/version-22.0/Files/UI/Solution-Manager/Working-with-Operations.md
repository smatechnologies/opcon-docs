# Working with Operations

Operations is an SMA Solution Manager module that shows high-level
summary information (by way of graphical dials) for schedules, jobs, and
Agent machines in operation. Each dial has drill-down capability to view
the details or processes on which the summary information is based.

## Filtering

The Filter bar at the top of the page can be used to filter the
schedules, jobs, and Agent machines based on what is stored in the
system for the current day, the day before, the day after, the last
seven days, and/or the next seven days.
