#  Using Tag Manager

The **Tag Manager** is designed to provide an easy way to create a tag,
look up a tag, associate jobs to a tag, and refer to a quick
cross-reference view of any jobs using that tag. It also allows you to
rename and delete tags.

 

When on the **Tag Manager** screen, it displays a drop-down list for tag
selection and a table to show all the schedules/jobs using the selected
tag.

 

**Tag Manager** also provides a **Type Filter Text** box in order to
type a part of or the full name for the specific item to display the
selection. You can also type an \* (asterisk) in front of a word in a
string if the string you are looking for is not necessarily at the
beginning of the string.

## Tag Manager Toolbar

The toolbar resides at the top-right corner of the screen. Click on any
specific icon on the toolbar below to learn more about its
functionality.
