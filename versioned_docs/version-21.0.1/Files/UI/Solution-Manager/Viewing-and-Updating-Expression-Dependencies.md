# Viewing and Updating Expression Dependencies

The **Expression Dependency** panel in **Daily Job Definition** displays
any defined expression dependencies related to the selected job.

- The panel can be placed in **Full Screen** mode by simply clicking
    the icon (![Full Screen Panel Icon     ](../../../Resources/Images/SM/Full-Screen-Mode-Icon.png "Full Screen Panel Icon"))
    to the far-right side of the panel bar. Escape **Full Screen** mode
    by clicking on the icon again.
- When the panel contains defined properties, a blue circular
    indicator containing a number (![Job Properties     Indicator](../../../Resources/Images/SM/Daily-Job-Definition-Properties-Indicator.png "Job Properties Indicator"))
    will appear to the right of the panel name to indicate the number of
    properties that have been defined.

## Adding or Updating Expression Dependencies

In **Admin** mode, expression dependencies can be updated. For
conceptual information, refer to [Property Expressions API Syntax](../../../reference/property-expressions-syntax.md)
 in the **Concepts** online help. For examples and use cases,
refer to the [Use Cases](../../../reference/property-expressions-syntax.md#Use)
 section.
