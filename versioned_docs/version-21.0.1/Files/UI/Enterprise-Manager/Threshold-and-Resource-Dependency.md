# Threshold/Resource Dependency

The **Threshold/Resource Dependency** tab allows you to define and
maintain job dependencies on threshold and resource values. Within the
tab, you will be able to:

- [Add Threshold/Resource     Dependencies](Adding-Threshold-and-Resource-Dependencies.md)
- [Edit Threshold/Resource     Dependencies](Editing-Threshold-and-Resource-Dependencies.md)
- [Delete Threshold/Resource     Dependencies](Deleting-Threshold-and-Resource-Dependencies.md)

For conceptual information, refer to [Threshold Dependencies](../../../job-components/threshold-resource-dependencies.md#threshold-dependencies)
 or [Resource Dependencies](../../../job-components/threshold-resource-dependencies.md#resource-dependencies)
 in the **Concepts** online help.
