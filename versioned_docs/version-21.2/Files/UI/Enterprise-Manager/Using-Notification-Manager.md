# Using Notification Manager

The **Notification Manager** is used to create groups based on Machine,
Schedule, and Job status change events in
OpCon then define triggers to send
notifications. User-defined group folders are created and displayed for
each item (Machines, Schedules, and/or Jobs). For all conceptual
information regarding the Event Notification System (ENS), refer to
[Event Notification](../../../notifications/Components.md)
 in the **Concepts** online help.

:::caution
All of the data in the **Notification Manager** table is updated every time a user makes a single change. If more than one user attempts to make a change at the same time, errors can occur. SMA Technologies recommends limiting the number of users in **Notification Manager** to one at a time.
:::

When on the **Notification Manager** screen, it displays a groups of
items, notification triggers inside the groups, and notifications
defined for each trigger.

**Notification Manager** also provides a **Type Filter Text** box in
order to type a part of or the full name for the specific item to
display the selection. You can also type an \* (asterisk) in front of a
word in a string if the string you are looking for is not necessarily at
the beginning of the string.

:::tip Example
In the Notification Manager screen, type **\*Level** to find a specific group that includes "Level" somewhere in the name.
