#  Using List View

The **List** view (Daily list) is used to display all dates that have
schedules built. When in this view, it contains a daily list of schedule
dates that can be expanded to show the schedule and job information. In
order for the schedule and jobs information to display in the **Gantt**,
**PERT**, **Bar Chart**, **Pie Chart**, and **Workload Chart** views,
you **must** first activate the **Send the current selection to other
views** button on the **Daily list** toolbar.

 

The **Listen for selection changes in other views** button must also be
activated in the views that receive the schedule and job information
(e.g., **Gantt**, **PERT**, **Bar Chart**, **Pie Chart**, and **Workload
Chart** views).

## List View Toolbar

The **List** view also has a toolbar that allows you to perform actions
in the view. Click on any specific icon on the toolbar below to learn
more about its functionality.
