You will need to use the Enterprise Manager encryption tool if a configuration value in OpCon requires an encrypted password.

To encrypt a password:

1. Log in to the Enterprise Manager.
2. Use menu path: **EnterpriseManager \> Password Update \> Password Encryption Tool**. The **Password encryption tool** dialog displays.
3. *(Optional)* Select the **Visible** checkbox to make the password characters visible.
4. Enter the password in the **Password** field.
5. Click **Encrypt**.
6. Click the **Copy to clipboard** button to copy the encrypted password.
7. Click **Close** to close the dialog.
8. Paste the encrypted password to the desired location.
