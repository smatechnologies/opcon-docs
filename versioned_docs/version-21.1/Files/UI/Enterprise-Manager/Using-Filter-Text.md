#  Using Filter Text

To use the filter text:

1.  Double-click on **List** under the **Operation** topic. The **Daily
    list** screen displays.
2.  Enter a *part of or the full name* for the schedule or job to
    display the filter results. You can also type an \* (asterisk) in
    front of a word in a string if the string you are looking for is not
    necessarily at the beginning of the string.
3.  Click the **Clear** button (to the right of the filter text box) to
    clear the filter results and return to the full list.
