# Working in User Mode

Users not in the «ocadm» role or a role with the «Maintain Vision
Actions», «Maintain Vision Frequencies», or «Maintain Vision Workspaces»
privileges will see a Vision Live page that is similar to the example
graphic here. These users, who must have the «View Vision Workspaces»
privilege, can only view cards on the Vision Live page and will not be
able to create, edit, or delete cards.
