#  Operations File Transfer Messages

In addition to displaying the completion percentage and the interim
transfer operations (e.g., compressing, decompressing, etc.), the EM
displays specific file transfer codes from the LSAM's participating in
the file transfer job. The Origination column identifies the error
location: the FTAgent (Destination) and/or the FTServer (Source).

## UNIX File Transfer Error Codes

File transfer errors received by STDOUT/STDERR may be viewed in the
EM's Job Output Retrieval System (JORS).

 

The messages in this section are output by the UNIX Agent and Server;
messages output by a non-UNIX Agent or Server will be different, and the
user is referred to the documentation for the appropriate LSAM. When the
destination machine is UNIX and an error originates in the Server, the
Agent will pre-pend "FTServer:" to the message to indicate that it
originated with the Server. For example:

 

FTServer: Error reading Temp File
\[/usr/local/lsam/tmp/FT_AHhs5/daily.txt.asc.10203\]
