# Managing Roles and Privileges

The Roles page is found in _Library > Access Management > Roles_, and provides the views to manage Roles and Privileges. A list of all roles that have been created in the system and a series of tabs is displayed on the Roles page. Select the name of a role to view the details of that role.

A series of tabs is displayed on the Roles page:

- [General](Role-General.md)
- [Activities](Role-Activities.md)
- [Batch Users](Role-Batch-Users.md)
- [Department Activities](Role-Department-Activities.md)
- [Resources](Role-Resources.md)
- [Users](Role-Users.md)

For conceptual help, see:

- [Privileges](../../../../../../administration/privileges.md)
- [Roles](../../../../../../administration/roles.md)
- [Users](../../../../../../administration/user-accounts.md)
