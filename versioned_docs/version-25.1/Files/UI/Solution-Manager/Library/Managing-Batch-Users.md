# Managing Batch Users

The **Batch User** editor is used to create and maintain the Batch Users
that are required for processing jobs on IBM i, MCP, OpenVMS, SQL, UNIX,
and Windows. Privileges are attached to these Batch Users, but the
privileges are managed in the **Batch User Privileges** screen. For
conceptual information, refer to [Batch User Privileges](../../../../administration/privileges.md#batch-user-privileges)
in the **Concepts** online help.

The editor contains a list of target operating systems and the
associated batch users, batch user details, and a button to help manage
batch user privileges.

## Batch Users Toolbar

The **Batch Users** editor also has a toolbar that allows you to perform
functions for managing the batch users. Click on any link about the toolbar below to learn more about its functionality.
