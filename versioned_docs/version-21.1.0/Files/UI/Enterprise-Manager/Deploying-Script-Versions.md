# Deploying Script Versions

The Deploy Version feature allows you to deploy a specific version of a script to all or a subset of Master jobs already associated with that script. Let's say, for example, you had previously associated "Version 3" of a script with ten different jobs in ten different schedules. You could use the deployment wizard to replace "Version 3" in all of those jobs with "Version 7" in a simple process.

To deploy a script version:

1. Double-click on **Repository** under the **Scripts** topic. The **Script Repository** screen displays.
2. Select a **script** in the list.
3. Click the **Show/Create Versions** button on the toolbar. The **Versions** dialog displays.
4. Select the **script version** that you wish to deploy.
5. Click the **Deploy** button. The **Deploy Version** dialog displays.
6. *(Optional)* Enter a part of or the full name for the schedule or job to filter the list of available jobs to redeploy.
7. Select the jobs in which you wish to redeploy the selected script version.
8. Click the **Deploy** button in the **Deploy Version** dialog.
9. Click **Yes** to confirm that you want to deploy the version.
10. Click **Yes** again if you wish to redeploy this version with any other jobs and repeat Steps 6 - 8. Click **No** if you do not and proceed to the next step.
11. Click the **Close** button in the **Versions** dialog.
12. Click **Close ☒** (to the right of the **Script Repository** tab) to close the **Script Repository** screen.
