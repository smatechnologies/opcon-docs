# Editing Schedule Frequencies

:::note
An existing (previously defined) frequency definition can be edited only if it is solely being used by that one schedule. If the existing (previously defined) frequency name is being used by another job or schedule, the details cannot be changed. In this situation, changes made to the details for the previously defined frequency names require a new frequency name.
