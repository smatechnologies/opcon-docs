# Using History Management

The **History Management** view is used to view the schedule and job history information.

**History Management** also provides a **Type Filter Text** box in order to type a part of or the full name for the specific item to display the selection. You can also type an \* (asterisk) in front of a word in a string if the string you are looking for is not necessarily at the beginning of the string.

:::tip Example
In the History Management screen, type **\*Build** to find the SMA_SKD_BUILD job in the AdHoc schedule.
