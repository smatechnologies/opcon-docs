# SMA Resource Monitor Wizards

The SMA Resource Monitor User Interface provides Wizards within the
**Add** and **Edit** functions for all monitor types and Action Groups.
There is a step pane on the left side of the screen that contains the
names of each step in the wizard.

## Start an Add Wizard

1. Click on the specific tab - **File Monitors**, **Counter Monitors**,
    **Service Monitors**, **Process Monitors**, or **Action Groups** -
    for the monitor type to add.
2. Click **Add**.

## Start an Edit Wizard

1. Click on the specific tab - **File Monitors**, **Counter Monitors**,
    **Service Monitors**, **Process Monitors**, or **Action Groups** -
    for the type of item to edit.
2. Click on the gray box to the left of the row for the specific
    monitor type or Action Group item that you want to edit and click
    **Edit**.

When the **Add** or **Edit** menu is selected from the SMA Resource
Monitor screen, a series of Wizard screens will serve as a guide for the
steps to add and/or edit parameters and actions for a new monitor. The
steps that are not being used are **Blue**. The step that is currently
being used is **Red**.

## Wizard Navigation

The Wizard screens contain the following navigation buttons:

- **Back**: Go back one step in the wizard (does not appear on the
    first step of the wizard since there are no previous steps).
- **Next**: Go to the next step in the wizard (does not appear on the
    Finalize step since there are no later steps).
- **Cancel**: A confirm cancellation message will display to decide
    (Yes or No) to close the Wizard without saving changes. If **Yes**
    is clicked, the wizard will close without saving changes. If **No**
    is clicked, the Wizard will return to the same page.
- **Finish**: Displays only on the Finalize page in place of the
    **Next** button. Selecting the **Finish** button will create the
    monitor or action group and close the wizard.

## Monitor Wizard Screens

The information in this section describes the wizard screen details for
all monitor types.

### First Screen: Enter Monitor Name

- **Monitor Name** (Required): Defines the name of the Monitor as it
    will appear on the main screen of the SMA Resource Monitor (maximum
    characters: 60). The following values are invalid for the monitor
    name: \\ (backslash), / (forward slash), : (colon), \* (asterisk), ?
    (question mark), " (quotes), < (less than), \> (greater than), |
    (pipe)
- **Documentation**: Provides a place to document monitor information.
- **Network Share**: For **File Monitors**, determines if the SMA
    Resource Monitor will poll the directory to detect the file. If
    checkbox is unselected, SMA Resource Monitor will use Windows alerts
    to optimize performance. If checkbox is selected, SMA Resource
    Monitor will poll the directory. This option should be enabled to
    monitor files on mapped drives.
  - **Poll Interval**: Defines the seconds between polling attempts
        for the Network Share setting.
    - Minimum Value: 1
    - Maximum Value: 86400
    - When setting this value, determine the amount of time within
            which the file should be acted upon.
    - When one SMA Resource Monitor is required to monitor high
            volumes of Network share files, it is important to stagger
            this value and set the highest values tolerated for the
            environment.
    - Because the SMA Resource Monitor creates 1 thread for every
            file it watches, the more often checking is performed, the
            more resources will be required of the machine the SMA
            Resource Monitor is running on.
- **Process Offline Changes**: Determines if the SMA Resource Monitor
    will process file events (e.g., creation, deletion, or modification
    of files) when the service is down.

### Second Screen: Monitor Parameters

Depending on the type of monitor being added or edited, the Monitor
Parameters step contains different details.

- [Auto-Disable and Auto Re-Enable Behavior](#Auto-Dis)
- [File Monitor Parameters](#File)
- [Counter Monitor Parameters](#Counter)
- [Service Monitor Parameters](#Service)
- [Process Monitor Parameters](#Process)

#### Auto-Disable and Auto Re-Enable Behavior

When SMA Resource Monitor automatically deactivates a Counter, Service,
or Process Monitor, it unselects the "Active" checkbox for that
monitor on the respective summary tab of the main SMA Resource Monitor
screen. To automatically re-enable the monitor, configure one or more of
the Auto Re-Enable Trigger settings.

If auto re-enable is configured, when SMA Resource Monitor automatically
deactivates a monitor, it disables the trigger, but keeps monitoring for
the re-enabling of the trigger and the "Active" box for the monitor in
the respective summary tab continues to show selected. To manually
enable the trigger again, unselect then select the "Active" checkbox
on the respective summary tab of the main SMA Resource Monitor screen.

#### File Monitor Parameters

- **File Name** (Required): Defines the full path and file name to be
    monitored. Wild cards are supported to indicate all files in a path
    or all files of an extension type, etc. UNC paths are also
    supported. The following values are invalid for the file name: \\
    (backslash), / (forward slash),
    : (colon), \* (asterisk), ? (question mark), " (quotes), < (less
    than), \> (greater than), | (pipe).
- **File State**: Defines the File State values to monitor:
  - **Create**: File Creation (default)
  - **Delete**: File Deletion
  - **SizeChange**: Change in file size (growth/shrink) based on
        File Size settings.
  - **AbsoluteSize**: Recognize when the size is exactly the size
        defined in the File Size field and then take appropriate
        actions.
  - **Modify**: File change (creation of new file, modify file size,
        change in timestamp).
  - **EOFMarker**: Check for a user-defined EOF marker to ensure the
        file is complete (allow wildcards in the EOF string)
  - **ScanString**: Check for a user-defined string in the file.
        (This does not have to be EOF marker.)
  - **InUse**: Check if the file is in use.
- **TrackScanString**: For the ScanString file state, indicates if the
    SMA Resource Monitor will remember the last ScanString location in a
    file for which it had previously triggered the rule. If marked, the
    SMA Resource Monitor will not re-trigger the rule for the same
    location in the file when it detects the file is modified again. The
    trigger will only fire again if new matches for the ScanString
    setting appear in the modified file. If the checkbox is clear, the
    rule will trigger for previously detected ScanString entries every
    time the file is modified.
- **Search String**: Defines the string to search for in the file when
    the file state is set to EOFMARKER or SCANSTRING.
  - Minimum Characters: 1
  - Maximum Characters: 512
- **File Size** (Optional): Defines the File State setting, and
    specifies the minimum file size that the Resource Monitor is looking
    for. If *AbsoluteSize* is the file state, SMA Resource Monitor will
    check if the file is *exactly* the size specified. For any     other file state, SMA Resource Monitor will check if the file is at least the size specified.
- **Create TimeStamp**: Defines the oldest create date for a file. If
    the create date/time stamp on the file is older than this date/time,
    SMAResourceMonitor will not process the file. The default value for
    the field is the minimum possible date so files with older time
    stamps are detected. The specific value is **1/1/1753 00:00**.
- **Wait Verify**: Defines the number of seconds the monitor will wait
    and verify that the required file state still exists, and that the
    file is still not in use. This setting is disabled for all file
    states, except *Create* and *Modify*.
  - Minimum Value: 1
  - Maximum Value: 1800 (30 minutes)
  - If the file is in use after the wait time, the
        SMAResourceMonitor will wait again for the Wait Verify time
        period and check again to see if the file is no longer in use.
        This process will repeat until the file is no longer in use -
        then the action group(s) will be triggered.

    :::tip
    Make sure the file is done arriving before it is created.

    For large file transfers, it takes time for the complete file to arrive. Set the 'Wait Verify' value high enough to make sure that the file should not have changed size in that time. As soon as the size matches the same previous size and the file is no longer in use, the action group(s) will be triggered.
    ::::
- **From Time**: Defines the start time for monitoring resources. This
    option provides a way to monitor resources only during a specified
    time period of the day.
- **To Time**: Defines the end time for monitoring resources. This
    option provides a way to monitor resources only during a specified
    time period of the day.
- **Max Concurrent Files**: Defines the maximum number of files to
    process concurrently if monitoring for a variable file name. This
    helps to throttle the processing to avoid overworking the SMA
    Resource Monitor Service and the Operating System.
  - Minimum Value: 1
  - Maximum Value: 100

:::note
A high value in this setting can cause the performance of SMA Resource Monitor to decrease.
:::

- **Max Concurrent Files Processing Delay**: Defines the amount of
    processing delay that is involved with the maximum number of files
    to process concurrently if monitoring for a variable file name.
