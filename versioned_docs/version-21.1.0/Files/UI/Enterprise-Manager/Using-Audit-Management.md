updates to the OpCon database. For conceptual
information, refer to [Legacy Audit Management](../../../utilities/Graphical-Utilities/Legacy-Audit-Management.md)
 in the **Utilities** online help.

**Audit Management** also provides a **Type Filter Text** box in order
to type a part of or the full name for the specific item to display the
selection. You can also type an \* (asterisk) in front of a word in a
string if the string you are looking for is not necessarily at the
beginning of the string.
