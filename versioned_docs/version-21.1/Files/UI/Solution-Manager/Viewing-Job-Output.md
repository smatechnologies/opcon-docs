# Viewing Job Output

The **Operations** module allows you to retrieve the output file(s) for
a job if it:

- is completed or has started
- is not a NULL or Container job
- does not have a status of Waiting, On Hold, Cancelled, Missed
    Start Time, or Skipped

:::note
Before attempting to view a job's output file, first refer to [Viewing a Job Output File](../../../operations/job-output.md) in the **Concepts** online help.
:::

To view job output:

Click on the **Failed**, **Running**, or **Completed** operation dial or
use the **Quick Search** field (type the keyword and click **Enter**) in
the **Jobs** section on the **Operations Summary** page.

page in the form of a breadcrumb trail.

    the output file or cancel the refresh operation.
