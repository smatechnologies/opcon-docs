# Navigation Editors

In the Enterprise Manager, the Navigation Editors(e.g., Schedule Master, Job Master, Calendars, Global Properties, Thresholds,
Resources, Machines, Machine Groups, Server Options, Roles, User
Accounts, Batch Users, Departments, Access Codes, Privileges) provide
screens to update information stored in the
OpCon database. Any number of editors can be
opened at the same time, but only one can be active at a time.

To perform the procedure:

1. Click on the arrow to expand a Navigation topic in the [Navigation     Panel](Navigation-Panel.md) to the left of the screen.
2. Double-click on the **Navigation Editor**(e.g., **Schedule
    Master**).
3. *(Optional)* Click on and drag the **Navigation
    Editor** tab onto the tab bar if not already attached.
4. Repeat Step 2 to open more editors.

## Changing Navigation Editor Tab Order

## Arranging Navigation Editors

To perform the procedure:
