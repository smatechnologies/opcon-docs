# Managing Frequencies

The **Frequencies** page is used to view, edit, and forecast frequencies. This page displays a list of existing frequencies. You can filter the list by frequency name, A/O/B/N value, calendar name and in-use count. You can view the master schedules and jobs that use the frequency by selecting the **Cross References** button in the toolbar. To view frequencies with duplicate frequencies, check the **Show Duplicate Frequency Configurations** checkbox. For conceptual information, refer to [Frequencies](../../../../../automation-concepts/frequencies.md) in the **Concepts** online help.
