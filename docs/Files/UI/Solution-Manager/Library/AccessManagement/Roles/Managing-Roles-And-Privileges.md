# Managing Roles and Privileges

The **Roles** page is found in _Library > Access Management > Roles_, and provides the views to manage roles and privileges. A list of all roles that have been created in the system and a series of tabs is displayed on the roles page. Select the name of a role to view the details of that role.

![Roles](../../../../../../Resources/Images/SM/Library/AccessManagement/roles-page.png 'Roles')

To sort the roles, select the sort icon ![Sort Icon](../../../../../../Resources/Images/SM/Library/AccessManagement/sort-icon.png 'Sort Icon').

Selecting a role displays a series of tabs that allow you to view and modify the details of the selected role. The tabs are:

- [General](Modifying-Roles-And-Privileges/General.md)
- [Activities](Modifying-Roles-And-Privileges/Activities.md)
- [Batch Users](Modifying-Roles-And-Privileges/Batch-Users.md)
- [Department Activities](Modifying-Roles-And-Privileges/Department-Activities.md)
- [Resources](Modifying-Roles-And-Privileges/Resources.md)
- [Users](Modifying-Roles-And-Privileges/Users.md)

To add, copy, or delete a role, use the context menu button ![Context Menu Button](../../../../../../Resources/Images/SM/Library/AccessManagement/context-menu.png 'Context Menu Button'). See the following sections for more information:

- [Adding Roles](Adding-Roles.md)
- [Deleting Roles](Deleting-Roles.md)
