# Managing Script Runners

The **Script Runners** editor is designed to provide a way to create and
manage the "interpreters" and associated command templates. These
templates will be passed to the Agent machine so that the Agent knows
how to execute the scripts that are received from the centralized
database. For more information about this concept, refer to [Embedded Scripts](../../../automation-concepts/embedded-scripts.md) in the
**Concepts**Â online help.

## Script Runners Toolbar

The toolbar resides at the top-right corner of the screen. Click on any
specific icon on the toolbar below to learn more about its
functionality.

## Right-Click Menu

Right-clicking on a script runner in the editor opens a menu that
provides the same options as the toolbar.
