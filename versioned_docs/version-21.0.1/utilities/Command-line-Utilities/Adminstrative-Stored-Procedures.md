# Administrative Stored Procedures

SMA Technologies provides several scripts and supplemental SQL stored procedures to aid in managing
OpCon:

- [SMA_CHGMACHINE](#SMA_CHGM)
- [SMA_CHG_UNIX_GIDUID](#SMA_CHG_)
- [SMA_CLEAN_ENS](#SMA_CLEA)
- [SMA_CLEARSCHED](#SMA_CLEA2)
- [SMA_COPYSCHED](#SMA_COPY)
- [SMA_DELETESCHED](#SMA_DELE)
- [SMA_MERGESCHED](#SMA_MERG)
- [SMA_SAMWATCH](#SMA_SAMW)

:::note
A SQL user without administrator privileges must be a member of the "opconspuser" role to use the administrative stored procedures.
:::

## SMA_CHGMACHINE

The SMA_CHGMACHINE stored procedure increases job-processing performance
by changing a heavily used LSAM machine's ID to 1. Because the SAM
operates in a processing loop, the machine with an ID of 1 receives
slightly more processing time. It is common for less critical machines
to be tested first with OpCon; therefore,
this causes more critical machines to have higher machine IDs. This
stored procedure allows the OpCon
administrator to move a critical production LSAM to the beginning of the
processing loop.

### Syntax

EXEC SMA_CHGMACHINE '<Machine Name\>'

#### Parameters

The stored procedure uses the following parameter:

- **<Machine Name\>**: The name of the LSAM whose MachineID is
    changed to 1.

### Changing a Machine's ID

To change the Machine ID of an LSAM, you must execute SMA_CHGMACHINE
then stop and restart the SMA Service Manager. Follow the procedure
provided to do so.

To change the LSAM Machine ID:

## SMA_CHG_UNIX_GIDUID

The SMA_CHG_UNIX_GIDUID stored procedure changes a Group ID and/or User
ID in the UNIX job details either for all schedules or for a single
schedule. This stored procedure is valid only for jobs running on
Machines with Non-XML formatted data.

### Syntax

EXEC SMA_CHG_UNIX_GIDUID
'OLDGID','NEWGID','OLDUID','NEWUID','SKDNAME'

:::note
The wrapping of the syntax in this document does not indicate the location of a carriage return; the â†µ indicates the location of a carriage return.
:::

#### Parameters

The following describes the parameters for the stored procedure:

- **OLDGID**: The existing UNIX Group ID the stored procedure is
    looking for.
  - The UNIX Group ID must not exceed seven characters.
  - Specifying NULL (without the quotation marks) for the OLDGID
        causes the stored procedure to ignore the Group ID while
        searching for records to update.
- **NEWGID**: The updated UNIX Group ID.
  - The UNIX Group ID must not exceed seven characters.
  - Specifying NULL (without the quotation marks) for the NEWGID
        causes the Group ID to remain at its current value.
- **OLDUID**: The existing UNIX User ID the stored procedure is
    looking for.
  - The UNIX User ID must not exceed seven characters.
  - Specifying NULL (without the quotation marks) for the OLDUID
        causes the stored procedure to ignore the User ID while
        searching for records to update.
- **NEWUID**: The updated UNIX User ID.
  - The UNIX User ID must not exceed seven characters.
  - Specifying NULL (without the quotation marks) for the NEWUID
        causes the User ID to remain at its current value.
- **SKDNAME**: The name of the target schedule.
  - The schedule name must not exceed 255 characters.
  - Specifying NULL (without the quotation marks) for the SKDNAME
        causes any changes to occur to all schedules in the database.

#### Examples

:::tip Example
With the following command, the stored procedure only affects rows with both a Group ID of 123 and a User ID of 45:

```sql
EXEC SMA_CHG_UNIX_GIDUID '123','789','45','56',NULL
```

:::

:::tip Example
With the following command, all UNIX jobs have the Group ID set to 789 and the User ID set to 56:

```sql
EXEC SMA_CHG_UNIX_GIDUID NULL,'789',NULL,'56', 'ProdSched1'

## SMA_DELETESCHED

The SMA_DELETESCHED stored procedure completely deletes a schedule from
the OpCon database. It removes all of the
jobs from the Daily schedule and from the Master schedule. It also
deletes the schedule record and the holiday calendar associated with
that schedule. All dependencies between jobs are also removed. If jobs
that still remain in the database have dependencies on jobs in this
schedule, SMA_DELETESCHED automatically deletes these dependencies.

dependencies, thresholds, events, and job history from the source
schedule to the target schedule. The stored procedure assumes the
following:

- There is no duplication of job names between the two schedules.
- Job history for the jobs from the source schedule appears as if they
    had always run on the target schedule.
- Schedule-related historical information (e.g., schedule start and
    finish times) for the Source Schedule is deleted and not transferred
    to the Target Schedule.

:::caution

## SMA_SAMWATCH

The stored procedure creates a new special SAMID with the same timestamp
as the actual SAM. The value stored in the special SAMID is the "old"
timestamp. The next execution compares the SAM's actual current
timestamp to the old timestamp. If the two are equal or the SAMID does
not exist, the SAM has stopped processing. If specified, the procedure
retries detecting the SAM at defined intervals. When SMA_SAMWATCH finds
that the SAM is not processing, it sends a Network Popup Message to a
single machine and writes a message to the Windows Event Log.

### Syntax

EXEC SMA_SAMWATCH SAMID,'Recipient',<\#1\>,<\#2\>

#### Parameters

The following describes the parameters for the stored procedure:

**SAMID**: The number assigned to the SAM processing in the
OpCon database. Normally, this number is 1.

**Recipient** (Optional): A host name or user name to receive a
notification, or a command file to execute when the SAM fails.

The stored procedure only allows one recipient.

The character limit is 255.

Always enclose the Recipient parameter in single quotation marks.

To specify a recipient for a Network Popup message, enter the host name
of the machine or enter the Windows User.

:::tip Example
EXEC SMA_SAMWATCH 1,'OpsMachine'
:::

To specify a command file, enter the executable's full path and file
name.

:::note
The command file may contain multiple net send commands or any other valid commands.
:::

- The path to the command file must not contain spaces.
- UNC path names are valid.
- If omitted, the recipient defaults to the hostname of the machine on
    which the store procedure executes.

:::tip Example
The following command executes a command file named if the SAM fails:

```sql
EXEC SMA_SAMWATCH 1,'C:\ProgramData\OpConxps\Scripts\sma_samwatch.cmd'
```

:::

**<\#1\>**: The number of times SMA_SAMWATCH retries when a SAMPULSE
record for the requested SAMID is absent. This situation may occur when
SAM is not running or during a SAM regeneration.

- If omitted, the default is 1.

**<\#2\>**:Â Determines the number of seconds between retry attempts.

- Valid values include integers ranging from 0 and 59.
- If omitted, the default is 5.

:::tip Example
After the following command attempts to detect the SAM seven times at 20 second intervals, the command executes a command file named "sma_samwatch.cmd" if the SAM has not been detected:

```sql
EXEC SMA_SAMWATCH 1,'C:\ProgramData\OpConxps\Scripts\sma_samwatch.cmd',7,20
```

:::
