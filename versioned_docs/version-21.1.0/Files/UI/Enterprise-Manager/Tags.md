#  Tags

The **Tags** tab in the [**Job Master**](Using-Job-Master.md)
editor allows you to define and maintain tags that should be associated
with the job. You may want to tag the job as "Critical" or as a part
of a program group. An unlimited number of tags can be defined for each
job. These tag names will be built into the Daily tables by the Schedule
Build process, and the **Operations** views can be filtered based on
these tags.

 

Within the tab, you will be able to:

-   [Add Tags](#)
-   [Find Tags](Finding-Tags.md)
-   [Delete Tags](Deleting-Tags.md)
