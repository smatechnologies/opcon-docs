# Roles - Users

The Roles page is found in Library -> Access Management -> Roles, and provides the views to manage Privileges and Roles. When you click on the Users tab, you will see a list of all the roles that have been created in the system. You can click on the name of a role to view the details of that role.

A series of tabs is displayed on the Roles page. The Users tab indicates the users that are assigned to the selected role.
