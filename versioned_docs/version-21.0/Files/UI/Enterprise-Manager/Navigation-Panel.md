# Navigation Panel

The **Navigation Panel** resides at the left-hand side of the Enterprise Manager application and contains the following expandable topics that present function items for editing and viewing information:

- [Solution Manager](Working-with-Solution-Manager.md)
- [Administration](Working-with-Administration.md)
- [Operation](Working-with-Operation.md)
- [Security](Working-with-Security.md)
- [Management](Working-with-Management.md)
- [External Tools](Working-with-External-Tools.md)
- [Information](Working-with-Enterprise-Information.md)
- [Support](Working-with-Enterprise-Support.md)

## Types of Navigation

Under each navigation topic, the function list provides two types of navigation:

- [Navigation Editors](Navigation-Editors.md)
- [Navigation Views](Navigation-Views.md)

Throughout the navigation process, you can customize the look and feel of the Enterprise Manager workspace to suit your individual needs, and multiple [Editors](Navigation-Editors.md) and [Views](Navigation-Views.md) can be opened at one time. This customized layout can be [saved and restored at the next startup](Preferences-from-EM.md#To_always_re-open_the_current_information) of the Enterprise Manager.
