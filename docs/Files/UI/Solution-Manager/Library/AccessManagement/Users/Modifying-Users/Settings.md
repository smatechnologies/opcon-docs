# User Settings

The Users page is found in _Library > Access Management > Users_, and provides the views to manage Users. When you click on the Users tab, you will see a list of all the users that have been created in the system. You can click on the name of a user to view and modify the details of that user.

A series of tabs is displayed on the Users page. The Settings tab displays the **Enable password expiration** and **Enable external tokens** settings.

To modify a User, edit the preferred fields and click **Save**.
