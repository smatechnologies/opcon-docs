# Reporting Problems

If you encounter a bug problem, you can report it directly through the Enterprise Manager. The activities of the
Enterprise Manager are recorded in a log file and when the bug is
reported, the log file will be gathered and attached to the reporting
email. These problems refer only to the Enterprise Manager itself; other
problems relating to the SAM or LSAM should be reported in the normal
way to the SMA Technologies support team.

To report an EM bug:

Before actually gathering the log files and recording the details of the problem, it is useful to set tracing on then re-produce the bug.

Click **Apply** then click **OK**.
