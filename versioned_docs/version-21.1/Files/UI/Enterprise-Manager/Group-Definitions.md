The **<Notification Trigger Type\>** frame provides options for
selecting all or specific machines, schedules, and jobs for the
notification group. This frame has the following options:

    contains the options to determine if all Machines, Schedules, or
    Jobs should be included or excluded from the notification group by

        group by default. Select the items in the list that you
        specifically want to include in the group.
