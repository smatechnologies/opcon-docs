# Machine Groups

A *machine group* displays the user-defined machines with common
characteristics and usage. All machines in a group must have a common
operating system. Additionally, all machines in a group must have the
same data structure for their jobs (i.e., all must be using either
Non-XML or all must be using XML).

The following information applies to defining machine groups:

- **Name**: Defines the name for the machine group.
- **Documentation**: Provides an area for descriptions, explanations,
    and notes that can be updated for the defined machine group.
     in the **Enterprise Manager** online help.
- **Machine OS Type**: Defines the OS Type for the machine group.
- **Machine Assignment**: Defines all assigned machines for the
    defined machine group. Machines in the group must have matching
    operating systems and communication protocols.
