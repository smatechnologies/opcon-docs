# Open Window to Host

The Open Window to Host feature provides a way to open an emulator for a remote connection to a machine defined in OpCon. Configure the preferences in the Enterprise Manager to set the different commands for each platform to call when executing the **Window to Host** shortcut from the Operation views. For more information, refer to [Setting Preferences for Window To Host](../Files/UI/Enterprise-Manager/Preferences-for-Windows-To-Host.md) in the **Enterprise Manager** online help.
