#  Using Workload Chart View

The **Workload Chart** view is useful to refer to at a glance if a
schedule or the schedules for that day have over run the estimated
runtime. There are a few preferences relating to the workload chart that
can be changed according to the user's preference. For additional
information on changing these preferences, refer to [Setting Preferences for Charts](Preferences-for-Charts.md).

 

The **Workload Chart** view displays the estimated run time and real run
time of completed jobs for the day. A progress bar at the bottom of the
chart indicates how many jobs from the workload have finished and how
many are still waiting or running. The Schedule Name or the Date appears
above the workload chart. In order for the schedule and jobs information
to display in the **Workload Chart** view, you **must** first click on
the **Listen for selection changes in other views** button on the
**Workload Chart** toolbar.

 

The **Send the current selection to other views** button must also be
activated in another view (e.g., **List** and/or **Matrix**).

## Workload Chart Toolbar

The **Workload Chart** view also has a toolbar that allows you to
perform actions in the view. Click on any specific icon on the toolbar
below to learn more about its functionality.
